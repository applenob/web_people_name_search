Aside from the auctions, evening entertainment also includes a Thursday night documentary about blind mountaineer Erik Weihenmayers recent ascent of Everest. On Friday night, Ill see you at Jared Ogdens slide show at the Ouray Cinema. On Saturday night, after the auction, the Ice Breakers Ball will commence with live music and free beer, the latter courtesy of our heroes at New Belgium. Sunday night after the Awards Ceremony, catch Jean Cristophe Lafaille and Ed Viesturs presentation on climbing big peaks. So climb with the best all day and then party with them at night. Youll feel like a rock (or ice) star.
Hangin with the pros

And if merely watching these folks isnt excitement enough, these and many other notable climbers will offer free clinics all weekend. Just a few examples: Climbing warlord Mark Twight will offer instruction on moving faster up the ice. Ed Viesturs will give students the skinny on expedition climbing. Abby Watkins will provide a women-only ice climbing 101. Malcolm Daly will demonstrate his approach to chicken-hearted and footless climbing. With more than 50 clinics led by the whos who of the field, Ouray is the only place youll want to be this weekend.
Lodging:
 The Victorian Inn (800-84-OURAY): a moderately priced motel
 The Riverside Inn (800-432-4170): offers cool cabins and special rates for ice climbers
 Box Canyon Lodge (970-325-4981): great mountain views, mineral springs hot tubs.
 Or consider staying in metro Montrose, less than an hour away.

Given that these clinics are already fully booked, youll want to attend Saturday nights live auction to bid on a day of climbing with one of these athletes. Thats right. You climbing with them. The auction will also offer more than $30,000 worth of climbing gearsome of which sold at absurdly low prices last year. All auction proceeds go to the maintenance and improvement of the Ice Park.

So the holidays are over and its back to the grind of school and work. You wish this werent the case. You want to rage against the dying of the light? This weekend would be a fine time to fend off reality a little longer as the Ouray Ice Festival commences with another annual four-day binge of climbing, competition, clinics and celebration in one of the most sublime mountain settings on the face of the earthor wherever else you may go.
Those recluses among you who avoid Ouray during Festival week ought to reconsider. A busy day in Ouray will still offer more opportunities to climb than a quiet day up at Rocky. Yes, the crowds at the Fest are big, but the Ice Park just keeps getting bigger. With more than 160 ice and mixed routes to choose from18 new this yearOuray simply satisfies. So bring your gear to the Fest because you will climb. Or forget your gear and climb using the festival sponsors top-of-the-line demos. And if youve never climbed at Ouray, consider this your mandatory pilgrimage to the mountain Mecca.

 Buen Tiempo: a good time and Mexican food
 The Ouray Coffee House: java and much more
 The Cottage Shoppe: ice cream, soup and such
You will also witness the worlds top climbers compete on some of the sickest routes in the park. And you wont just watch them climbyoull also listen to them grunt and cuss into the mikes they wear as they figure-four and -nine their way to glory or defeat. Climbers will be judged according to such criteria as skill, artistry, efficiency, beauty of line and difficulty. Such ice jocks as Sean Isaac, Jared Ogden and Scott Semple will compete with more than a dozen others for the mens title. The womens field includes such luminaries as Kim Csizmazia, Sue Nott and Abbey Watkins.
How much does all this cost, you ask? Whats the entrance fee? Guess what. Ouray is a free, nonprofit facility that exists purely to provide joy. Such icy hotbeds of hedonism are rare and precious in this world, so listen carefully. The Ouray Ice Park cordially invites you to become a member for $35. Like the auction proceeds, this money helps the park improve and expand and rewards members with discounts at participating local lodges, restaurants and shops. And participation in the Ice Fest Gear Auction is open to members only. So ante up; support the park; enjoy the privileges and climb with better karma. But heed this paradox before you hit the Festival this weekend: The peerless ice, endless variety and easy accessibility of climbs in Ouray will satisfy you so thoroughly that your appetite for swingin and kickin in The Park will become insatiable.
