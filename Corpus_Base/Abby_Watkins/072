Arioso Dance was born on the outside of the Scotia Bank Dance Centre, as a group come together to claim the new space in it's opening week by dancing over the outside surfaces of the building.  An eclectic and highly skilled group of dancers, mountaineers, climbing guides and circus performers, the company has since performed in Montreal, Banff, Taipei Taiwan, the Squamish Chief, Nanaimo and, of course, Vancouver.  Dances are created 'on site' as each building, wall, cliff face, tower or other three dimensional space is unique and thus inspires it's own unique movement.
