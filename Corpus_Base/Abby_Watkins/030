Ueli Steck,
our host in Interlaken, climbing shirtless on White Out, M10. We've been
training here a lot, good spot, a good effort by Robert Jasper to develop it so

Abby Watkins, Rich Marshall, Ben Firth and I are over here competing in the
third Ice World Cup. Basically it's going well; some readers may remember I gave
the organizers a fair amount of grief and vice versa when I won the series a
couple of years back, but things do seem better now for sure. Kirov was a great
experience, more on that later, and now we're off to Pitztal. Here's some
totally random photos in the meantime...
Approaching Isenfluh--you take the tram
up and then "Rodle" (that's the sled) down to the climbs. Now that's a
proper approach...
