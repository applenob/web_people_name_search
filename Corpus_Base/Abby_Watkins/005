Abby Watkins (AUS/USA)

Abby will arrive in Australia 2 weeks before Escalade 99.
Good quality photos are available of Abby.
Abby travels to Australia to compete at Escalade every two years and
    in past years she has won the speed climbing event and placed third in the
    difficulty competition. Abby conducts workshops and makes a living from
    coaching and working in climbing gyms in the USA. A recent broadening of
    her interests to include mountaineering on snow and ice peaks has seen her
    team up with Australian climber Vera Wong for some demanding first ascents
    in the Karakorum in Asia.
She will be available for phone interviews from the USA.
