Back in October '96, Alexander Markham wrote a review of WestWind
Airlines for the Aviation Home Page. He honored our web site with "Select
Site" status. For the record guys... they consider content and
presentation and then provide an "Overall" rating.
The Aviation Home Page Honors WestWind With
"Select Site" Status...
Congratulations to WestWind airlines on their 1 million hits. This is a huge amount of
hits for a Virtual Airline. WestWind is one of the world's largest VA's and it has hubs in
many locations. A good thing about this airline is its fleet diversity, it has a large
fleet of aircraft painted in their colours which is sure to please any Virtual Pilot.
