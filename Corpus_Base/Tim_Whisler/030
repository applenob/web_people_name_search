In this breakout
            session, Dr. Marnie Moist, Dr. Pedro Muino, Dr. Tim Whisler, and Ms.
            Pat Serotkin will summarize the results of their committees' work on
            General Education assessment this past year. This session is an
            opportunity for faculty to review survey results and to make
            recommendations before further initiatives occur. Plans for next
            year's work on assessing faculty perspectives on knowledge outcomes
            will also be discussed.
