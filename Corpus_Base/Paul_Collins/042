One of the first U.S. punk bands, The Nerves wrote and recorded Hanging On The Telephone, a hit song  later recorded by Deborah Harry and Blondie. The Nerves included Peter Case, Jack Lee and Paul Collins. When The Nerves disbanded, Paul Collins formed The Beat and Peter Case would go on to form The Plimsouls. Paul Collins has had much success, touring with the likes of The Ramones, The Jam, Sting And The Police, Pere Ubu, Huey Lewis And The News and Nikki Corvette among others.
