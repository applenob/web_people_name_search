Born in England, Paul Collins emigrated with 
                                his family to New Zealand, and at eighteen came 
                                to Australia. In 1975, he launched the first issue 
                                of VOID, a science fiction magazine. Since then 
                                he has published Australia's best science fiction 
                                authors.

Paul has an easy-going manner and his talks cover 
                                his writing, editing and life experience.
Paul must be regarded as one of Australia's most 
                                prolific short story writers in the genre. His 
                                stories have appeared in 140 magazines such as, 
                                Eidolon, Aurealis, PC User, Orbit, Challenge, 
                                Pursuit, Omega, Cicada and anthologies like Gothic 
                                Ghosts, Urban Fantasies, Alien Shores and Dreaming 
                                Downunder.
His talks are aimed primarily at boys between 
                                the ages of 6-15, although he handles mixed classes 
                                very well. The boys especially like Paul's martial 
                                arts books and experiences, and enjoy Paul's demonstrations 
                                at the end of the talk!
