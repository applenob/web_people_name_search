Thomas Baker served as a Private 
during the Revolutionary War under Capt. William Nall and Capt. Martin Gambill, 
under Col. Benjamin Cleveland and Gen. Griffith Rutherford.
I did not find Thomas Baker mentioned in 

Wilkes County N.C., Court Minutes, 1778-1788.
I was unable to find widow Mary Cantrell Baker 
on the 1840 census. She was not a head of household, nor did any of the Baker 
households (which see) have a female her age 
residing with them. She was probably with a married daughter that year.
For the 1850 census, widow Mary was living in 
Ashe County with the James and Jane Ready (or Reedy) family. One would assume 
that Jane was Mary's daughter or granddaughter. The only Baker nearby was
Adam Jackson Baker (c1815) who was ten 
households away. Others list him as her son, but I've seen no proof yet, other 
than proximity.

1790 census analysis (based on available 
evidence): (Explanation of this census)
Thomas Baker was born 
1760/65 per census analysis. His widow stated that he was 66 when he died in 
March 1831. If correct, that puts his birth year at either 1764 or 1765, both of 
which match his census records. I don't know where he was born exactly, though 
certainly in Virginia (probably Culpeper County).
Unknown Son (1810/20). 
Thomas Baker had an unidentified son this age. He 
was home with him in 1820 (aged under 10, born ca 1810-20), but gone by 1830 so 
probably married or dead by then.
One flaw with the above is in
DNA test results. A descendant of Hiram 
Baker has taken the DNA test, and his results do not match those in the 
Thomas Baker (1711-1777) group. If Hiram was a son of Thomas (1765) his male 
Baker descendants should have nearly identical Y-Chromosome DNA results. In 
fact, as of this writing (04-17-2006) the Hiram Baker DNA results match no one 
else in the Baker DNA study.
Thomas Baker died either on 4 Mar 1831 or 14 Mar 
1831 (both dates given in Mary's Pension Affidavits), in Ashe Co., NC. The last 
affidavit gave 4 Mar 1831 as the date, so it was probably more accurate.
Thomas Baker was listed on the 1820 census in Ashe 
Co, NC. There were quite a few Baker families in Ashe County, NC (which 
see). Unfortunately, 
the 1820 Ashe County census was alphabetical, so we can't determine where anyone 
lived, nor who their neighbors were.
I didn't find Mary "Molly" Cantrell Baker on the 1860 census. She probably 
died before then.
Register Report
Unknown Daughter (1804/10)
Unknown Daughter (1810/20). 
Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age. 
She was home with him in 1820 (aged under 10, born ca 1810-20),  but gone by 1830, so probably married or 
dead by then.
Thomas Baker was still in Ashe Co, NC for the 1830 
census (which see). Fortunately, this one was in the original order, so we can determine 
(more or less) where each person lived and who their neighbors were. 
James 
Baker (1790/1800) was five houses away. Hiram 
Baker (1804) was three houses away.
This could be
Adam Jackson Baker (c1815). I have no 
direct evidence linking them, but Jackson Baker was very close to widow Mary 
Cantrell Baker on the 1850 census, in fact the only Baker listed even remotely 
close to her. He does fit age-wise. I have nothing else that connects them 
though. See his own page for more on him.
Children of Thomas Baker and 
      Mary Cantrell. 
Thomas Baker had lots of children per the 1790 
through 1830 census records. I have not identified any of them yet, though I 
suspect that Hiram Baker (c1804) is his son, 
but have no solid proof. In the Pension files it is mentioned the first two 
      children (a boy and a girl) died young, but that they raised a large 
      family. Unfortunately none of them were named. In Mary's last affidavit 
      (in 1856), a Mr. John W. Baldwin and a Mary Baker were witnesses. One 
      would assume they were related, but I don't know how.
Widow Mary Cantrell Baker was living with 
      James and Jane (---) Ready in 1850. Jane was born ca 1824/25 per that 
      census and close to that per 1860. This doesn't match any of Thomas and 
      Mary's children per the census records. This suggests that Mary could be a 
      granddaughter or perhaps not even related. I'm listing Jane as a 
      grandchild of Thomas and Mary for now, just so I don't lose track of her.
Unknown Son (1790/1800) 
Thomas Baker had an unidentified son this age. He 
was home in 1800 (aged under 10, born ca 1790-1800), but gone by 1810, so 
probably married or dead by then.
Note on
      Baker DNA Study: No proven 
      descendant of Thomas Baker has yet taken the test, however if his 
      parentage is correct, he should match those in the "Thomas Baker 
      1711-1777" group, for that Thomas (1711) is grandfather to Thomas (1765). 
      This Baker DNA group has four participants so far, all of whom are from 
      David Baker (1749-1838) who would be an uncle of this younger Thomas 
      (1765). They all match one another as they should. One DNA match is a 
      descendant of Adam Jackson Baker (1815). 
      His parents are unproven but some think he is a son of Thomas (1765). DNA 
      certainly supports that theory but doesn't prove it.
Unknown Daughter (1800/04). 
Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age. 
She was home in 1810 (aged under 10, born ca 1800-10), and still home in 1820 
(age 16-25, born ca 1794-1804), but gone by 1830 so probably married or dead by 
then.
Unknown Son (1810/15)
Persons researching this family (click 
      here for data on how to get on or off of this list):
Unknown Daughter (1810/20)
Thomas Baker appears to be a son 
of William Baker and Anne Gambill of Culpeper and Botetourt Co., VA. I 
have not researched that family, but I've seen bits of evidence that seem to 
support this connection.
Unknown Daughter (1794/1800)
1820 census analysis (based on available 
evidence): (Explanation of this census)
A descendant of Adam Jackson 
Baker has taken the DNA test and his 
results match those in the Thomas Baker (1711-1777) group. This means he 
certainly could be a son of Thomas Baker (1765-1831). It doesn't prove they are 
father and son, but it certainly proves they are related.
In the 1850's (through 1856) widow "Molly" Baker made several affidavits to 
get a Pension based on her late husband's Revolutionary War service. These are 
recorded in Pension File R-430. Mrs. Nancy Gambill, aged 94, widow of Martin 
Gambill also made a statement on her behalf in 1854.
The Bakers lived with Thomas' 
uncle Martin Gambill for a few years right after they married (per Pension 
files). However they don't actually seem to be with them on the 1787 census. 
Martin Gambill was listed on that census in Wilkes in Capt. Nall's company 
(William Nall who was listed next door to him, and whose daughter Gambill had 
married). Gambill's household contained one male aged 21 to 60 (born between ca 
1727 and ca 1766). That would be Gambill himself. He also had two boys under 21 
(born ca 1766-1787), one of which could be  Thomas Baker, but it doesn't 
quite fit. There was only one female in the house which was most likely Mrs. 
Gambill (Nancy Nall). Morris Baker was just 
two houses away. That suggests, but doesn't prove a relationship between the two 
Baker families.
By 1815, Thomas Baker was back in Ashe County 
again. He was listed on the tax list there for the year 1815 in "Captain 
Weaver's District."  Thomas had 250 acres on "South Fork", valued at $400, 
and was taxed for 1 poll (himself). Other Bakers were in this same district, 
including Morris Baker, John Baker, 
Elijah Baker,
Zechariah Baker and 
James 
Baker (these last two were also on South Fork).
Unknown Son (1810/15). 
Thomas Baker had an unidentified son this age. He 
was home with him in 1820 (aged under 10, born ca 1810-20), and still home in 
1830 (aged 15-19, born ca 1810-15).
I strongly suspect that 
this unknown son is Hiram Baker (c1804). My 
proof is all circumstantial:

Unknown Son (1804/10). 
Thomas Baker had an unidentified son this age. He 
was home with him in 1810 (aged under 10, born ca 1800-10), and still home in

dead by then.

Unknown Son (1774/84). 
Thomas Baker had an unidentified son this age. He 
was home with him in 1790 (aged under 16, born ca 1774-1790), and still home in 
1800 (aged 16-25, born ca 1774-1784), but gone by 1810, so probably married or 
dead by then.

Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age. 
She was home with him in 1810 (aged under 10, born ca 1800-10), and still home in 
1820 (aged 10-15, born ca 1804-10), but gone by 1830, so probably married or 
dead by then.
Thomas did have an unidentified 
son this age per census analysis.
The author (Marty Grant) 
      is not related to Thomas Baker as far as can be proven. I have a 
      feeling that he is a cousin to my ancestor
      Jacob Baker (1760/65), but no proof of 
      that yet. They may not be related at all.
1800 census analysis (based on available 
evidence): (Explanation of this census)
Unknown Daughter (1784/94)
I found Thomas Baker on the 1810 census back in 
Wilkes County.  He was not listed near the other Bakers there that year (which 
see). His household contained several females who were old enough to have 
been listed back in 1800 but who were not. I don't know who they were.
Thomas Baker is listed on the 
1790 census in
Wilkes County. He was in the 10th Company. There was one other Baker there, though 
not listed nearby, Ab. Baker (Abraham or Abram Baker).  Thomas' uncle and 
foster-father Martin Gambill was also in that district.
Thomas Baker was named in Wilkes County court on 4 
Feb 1796 as the overseer of the road replacing Elijah Pennington. The road 
description was not given. (From

Wilkes County, N.C., Court Minutes 1789-1797, this was his only mention in 
that book).
DNA test results seem to remove 
Thomas from being a candidate for Hiram's father. However, with just one test 
result we can't rule it out completely. There are always anomalies. If a second 
proven descendant of Hiram (from a different branch of his family) were to take 
the test and his results matched the others, then that would prove there is 
probably no anomaly.
For the 1800 census, Thomas Baker was listed in 
Ashe County along with several other Bakers (which see). Unfortunately this census was 
alphabetical, so I can't tell who Thomas' neighbors were, nor where he was 
living. For some reason, Thomas' household contained 4 adult males, I don't know 
who these were, whether relatives, or just boarders.  His wife's age is way 
off here, but that is a typical census problem. There seem to be other problems 
with this listing as well as he had children in 1810 who should have been listed 
back in 1800 but weren't.
Unknown Daughter (1794/1800) 
Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age. 
She was not home in 1800, but was with him in 1810 (aged 10-15, born ca 
1794-1800), and gone by 1820, so probably married or dead by then.

home in 1830 (aged 30-39, born ca 1790-1800).
Unknown Son (1810/20)
Unknown Daughter (1815/20). 
Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age. 
She was home with him in 1820 (aged under 10, born ca 1810-20), and still home 
in 1830 (aged 10-14, born ca 1815-20).
I did not find Thomas Baker mentioned in

Wilkes County, N.C Deed Books A-1, B-1 and C-1, 1778-1803. Martin Gambill 
was mentioned with land on Peach Bottom Mountain (present day Alleghany County) 
and Orr Knob.
Unknown Daughter (1815/20)
Mary or Molly was born ca 
1767/68 per her age of 82 on the 1850 census.  In her deposition of 7 Dec 
1851 she was listed as 83 years old, which agrees with the 1850 census entry. 
She stated she had no record of her age, and that her husband was "much" older 
than she. Actually he was only about 4 or 5 years older!

Hiram named his oldest son 
"Thomas"
On 6 Aug 1808, Thomas Baker  and John Sales 
witnessed a deed in Wilkes County from Margery Reaves to
Zebediah Baker for land on Middle Fork 
of Hunting Creek. Thomas signed with a mark. [Wilkes Co, NC Deed

Note: Much family data 
      is found in Revolutionary War Pension file R-430 wherein Thomas' widow 
      Molly applied for a pension based on his service.
Hiram was near Thomas on the 
1830 census.
Unknown Son (1774/84)
Unknown Daughter (1784/94). 
Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age. 
She was not home with him in 1790 or 1800, but was home in 1810, aged 
16-25 (born ca 1784-1794). This absence from the earlier records may indicate 
that this isn't a daughter at all, but someone else who was just living with him 
in 1810. She was no longer with him by 1820.
Unknown Daughter (1804/10). 
Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age. 
She was home with him in 1810 (aged under 10, born ca 1800-10), and still home in 
1820 (aged 10-15, born ca 1804-10), but gone by 1830, so probably married or 
dead by then.
Unknown Daughter (1804/10)
Unknown Daughter (1794/1800). 
Thomas Baker had an unidentified daughter this age. 
She was not home in 1800, but was with him in 1810 (aged 10-15, born ca 
1794-1800), and gone by 1820, so probably married or dead by then.
Thomas Baker was not listed on 
the 1787 State Census of North Carolina in Wilkes County. Several other Bakers 
were listed in that county though (which see).
In 1799,
Ashe County was formed 
from the north western portion of Wilkes County, including the area were Thomas 
Baker lived (or else he moved into that area in the 1790's). It is possible that 
he lived near the border, for he seemed to be back and forth in Wilkes and Ashe.
When Thomas was still young his 
father was killed by Indians. Thomas was principally raised by his uncle Martin 
Gambill.
After the war Thomas Baker 
married Mary "Molly" Cantrell in Wilkes County. Her maiden name and the 
date of marriage was given in her widow's pension application. In her first 
deposition (7 Dec 1851) she listed 20 Mar 1786. In another deposition (31 Aug 
1854) she listed 20 Mar 1787, and finally in 1856 she listed 22 Sep 1787. I 
assume the last is most accurate. She mentioned she had no record of the 
marriage, nor was there a marriage bond for they married "by publication" 
(banns). They were married in Wilkes by William Nall, Justice of the Peace.
