Research has found a Thomas Baker, who served 3 years as a soldier in the Virginia State Artillery during the Revolutionary War.  In 1783 this Thomas Baker received a Military Warrant for 100 acres of land in Kentucky.  This may, indeed, be our Thomas Baker, but further research is needed to prove or disprove this finding.
Thomas, along with his father Humphrey and family, returned to their 436 acres of land on the Middle Fork of the Holston River about 1766/67.  In 1770 Thomas was listed as tithable next to his father Humphrey and brothers John and George in Botetourt Co. (later Fincastle/Washington Co., VA).  In April of 1773 Thomas signed a petition to call Presbyterian minister, Rev. Cummings, to Sinking Spring and Ebbing Springs churches in Washington County.  In 1774 Thomas was surveyed for 328 acres on Reedy Hill Creek, South Fork of the Holston River (near present Needmore, VA), a few miles from Humphrey's land.
History of Thomas Baker
Thomas served as a "spy" under Colonel Andrew Lewis' command during "Lord Dunmore's War" in 1774.  He was wounded in the left arm and right hip at the Battle of Point Pleasant in October 1774  He later received a pension from the State of Virginia for these wounds while living his last years in Estill Co., Kentucky.  Thomas is listed on the monument at Point Pleasant W/V honoring the soldiers who participated in the Battle at Point Pleasant in 1774.
Thomas Baker was born about 1737, location unknown, and died September 29, 1814, in Estill Co., Kentucky.  Thomas made his will the day before he died, listing children:  Jacob Baker; the heirs of Joseph Baker; Humphrey Baker; William Baker; the heirs of Thomas Baker Jr.; and daughters, Betsy Nix, Polly Bell, Sally Hubbard, and Caty Baker.  At this time it is unknown who the wife or wives of Thomas Baker were.

Thomas is not listed in the 1782 tax list of Washington Co., Virginia, though his father Humphrey and brothers, John, George, Robert, and Alexander, are.  It is believed, but not proven, that he was in the area of Madison Co., Kentucky, at that time.  Thomas is on the first tax list, 1787, of the newly formed Madison County.  Thomas purchased 150 acres on Tate's Creek and 200 acres on Muddy Creek in Madison County. He also paid taxes on his father's 449 acres of land, located at Station Camp Creek on the Kentucky River.
In 1752, Thomas moved to future Washington County Virginia with his parents, where 436 acres was surveyed for Humphrey on April 9, 1753, on Stalnakers Creek, today's Hutton Creek,near the present town of Glade Spring.  The land which lay on both sides of the creek included the path over Walker Mountain to the North fork of the Holston and beyond and northwest of Stalnaker, who had settled on Indian fields in 1750.  This made Humphrey the western most settler at the time.   Stalnaker only had a lease "to crop" for his trading post settlement.  Historian J. Allen Neal in his bicentennial history of Washington County, Virginia incorrectly concluded that the Stalnaker settlement was "west of that of Baker" that Hutton Creek was Stalnaker's Creek and Baker's Creek was the stream that follows the Smyth-Washington County line.  Actually, Stalnaker's Creek, Baker's Creek, and the present day Hutton's Creek, are one and the same, depending on which period of history is being considered.  The survey from patents and deeds confirm it.  For many years after 1752, the Baker settlement was the farthest outpost of the frontier.
Thomas served as a member of the Bedford Co., Virginia, militia at the height of the first phase of the French and Indian War in 1758.  He received pay in 1759 for his services as a soldier at Fort Fauquier on the James River as a member of Col. John Buchanan's Company.  He was a member, as was his father, of Capt. Alexander Sayer's "Troop of Horse" Company.
