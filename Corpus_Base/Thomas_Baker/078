Our Uncle Thomas R. Baker served aboard this ship. The document we have 
      is the discharge certificate. 
      It states he enlisted as Apc. Sea. On 3 April 1924. At Jacksonville, FL. 
      For Minority years.
      Ratings held: Apr.Sea; Sea.2c; SK3c; SK2c.
      Service
      NTS Hampton Roads, VA; USS WEST VIRGINIA.

      Rating at discharge Storekeeper second class (AA) 270-08-02

      Discharge date is 28 January 1928

      He re-enlisted 13 August 1931 for 2 years, special temporary enlistment in 
      the U.S.C.G.

      U.S.N.R.S. Detroit, Michigan
      8 January 1942, enlisted this date to serve 2 full years in the USNR.
      This was the time I was old enough to remember. Have picture of him in 
      uniform. He served on destroyer. U.S.S. John D. Henley, in the Pacific. 
      Cannot find a discharge date for this time of service.
      But remember him telling of watching a kamikaze attack, and another time 
      being able to see flamethrowers on an island.

      Can you imagine, his monthly rate of pay was $72 a month. The paid him 
      0.05 cents per mile to go from San Pedro, California to Tampa, FL. When 
      discharged from U.S.S. West Virginia.

      Included in the things I found in my parents house, is a copy of the menu 
      for Thanksgiving Day, November 27, 1924 when the ship was at San Pedro, 
      California. Besides all the food that is listed, it ends with coffee, 
      cigars and cigarettes. (E.R. Corlett, Chief Commissary Steward, U.S.Navy
      
      Sometimes it really pays to go through papers one sheet at a time. You 
      never know what you will find. I do not remember the family ever talking 
      about my uncle's previous service.

      I will be glad to make copies of these 2 documents if you would like to 
      have them. Because of 9/11 I never received the paperwork I requested 
      about his discharge at the end of WW!!.

      Sincerely,
