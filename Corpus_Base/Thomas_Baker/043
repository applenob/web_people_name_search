Thomas Merton's Correspondence with:Â Baker, James Thomas, 1940-
James Thomas Baker, at the time of writing, was a graduate student in humanities at Florida State University.  He was writing an interdisciplinary dissertation about Merton in literature, the arts, and religion (see "Related Information" below).  Baker first came to know of Merton's writings while a student of Glenn Hinson at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, KY.

In this interesting group of letters, Merton provides insights on how the body of his works were viewed within the Church, by the academic community, and by non-Catholics like James T. Baker, a Baptist.
