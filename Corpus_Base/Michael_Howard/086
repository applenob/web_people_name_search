I trust it will be a happy, healthy and peaceful New Year for you and
your family.
With my warmest wishes,
Conservative Party leader Michael Howard offers his personal message to the Jewish community for Rosh Hashanah.
May this time of year be one of celebration for all members of the Jewish community, as well as a time of contemplation and reflection.
Michael Howard
