Another Howard: man most likely to challenge Blair?
But this was not the direct consequence of any legislation, more a response by the courts to a perceived desire on the part of the public, articulated by politicians, for tougher sentences.
Ann Widdecombe, who served as his deputy at the Home Office, said there was "something of the night about him", an opaque yet intentionally unflattering description that has stalked him ever since and probably always will.
Born in south Wales in 1941, the son of Jewish immigrants from Romania, Michael Howard was educated at Llanelli Grammar School. He went on to study law at Cambridge, where his debating skills made him a star of the Union.
It is a caricature that Mr Howard's friends find hard to fathom. His interests are catholic: he likes football (Liverpool is his team) and horse-racing; he enjoys a wide range of music from jazz to pop; he rarely speaks disparagingly of colleagues, even in private - an unusual trait among politicians.
After he became MP for Folkestone in 1983, his rise was meteoric and he reached the Cabinet within seven years.
In his memoirs, Mr Major wrote: "Michael is clever and able, but in private is a shy and charming man, with an unstuffy, self-deprecating manner. He was always at his best without an audience; in public he could not help stirring things up.
Rarely in politics has the public persona so belied the private man. How has this demonisation come about?
He is fiercely loyal. Throughout the recent Tory leadership fiasco few will have heard him utter anything derogatory about Mr Duncan Smith. He was standing by the Tory leader outside Conservative Central Office on Tuesday just as he stood by Mr Major in his troubled times.
At this point it must have been tempting to return to the Bar or earn a lot of money in the City. Instead, he took up the post of shadow foreign secretary under William Hague for two years before returning to the backbenches.
Even today, the criminal justice measures he wanted to introduce then are going through Parliament in one shape or another making it difficult for Labour to traduce his time at the Home Office.
His contemporaries included Kenneth Clarke, Norman Lamont, John Gummer, Leon Brittan and Norman Fowler, a group of friends who became known as the "Cambridge mafia". Two decades later, they occupied the upper reaches of the Thatcher and Major cabinets, though Mr Howard arrived at Westminster later after searching forlornly for a seat and then practising as a planning lawyer.     In the meantime he had married Sandra Paul, a Sixties model, who calls him "an extraordinarily romantic man".  They have two children and one of the strongest of Westminster marriages.
As home secretary, he made mistakes and suffered defeats. He was probably wrong to increase the sentence tariff on the Bulger killers, but he felt it was his function to reflect public revulsion.
Yet his image in the country is as a ruthless, Right-wing ideologue, someone who intimidated Whitehall officials and who places ambition ahead of principle.    He was once called "the most hated home secretary in living memory".
By 1997, he was well positioned to challenge for the succession to John Major yet secured just 23 votes from his fellow MPs, trailing in last. Some felt he was too clever by half; others that he trimmed his sails according to the prevailing political winds. Their suspicions were articulated by Miss Widdecombe.
Like Mr Blunkett, he wanted to introduce ID cards but was beaten back by a cabinet revolt. He tried to limit trial by jury - just as the present Government is doing - but lost in the Lords. He introduced an ill-considered ban on handguns, but after the Dunblane massacre the political pressure for prohibition was almost irresistable.
The penal slogan most commonly associated with Mr Howard is "prison works". From the moment he became home secretary - a stewardship that began with the public angst generated by the appalling murder of Jamie Bulger by two 10-year-old boys - the prison population began to increase.
Yet there is little that Mr Howard proposed then that was not taken up by the Labour government in 1997 and built on subsequently by Jack Straw and now David Blunkett.
Mr Howard's time at the Home Office was blighted by several high-profile prison escapes and there is no question that he might have handled the fall-out better. He gave the impression of a politician seeking to blame his officials.  Derek Lewis, the director general of the Prison Service, was fired. Miss Widdecombe's animus stems from this period.
His opposition to further European integration offended Europhile Tories at the time but is now mainstream party policy.

Yet while his qualities are known to his colleagues and his parliamentary skills are unquestionable, he will have the hardest task persuading voters that he is not an unfeeling and faintly sinister throwback to the Major era.
Most people who have had personal dealings with Michael Howard have found him an engaging and scrupulously polite individual. He is articulate, as befits a QC, fiercely intelligent and honest.

However, there is a good deal of revisionism now taking place about Mr Howard's stewardship of the Home Office. His predecessors, Douglas Hurd and Kenneth Clarke, are seen as too soft - during their time in the post, the crime level grew to more than five million.
Mr Howard's tough line - famously set out in his 27 points at the Conservative conference in 1993 - also found little favour with the judiciary, who felt that their independence was being constrained. They fought his attempts at reform tooth and nail, feeding an impression of ministerial disarray that by then had infected the entire Tory government.
But the fact remains that burglaries and car thefts began to fall from 1993 onwards, when measured by the British Crime Survey, which is the current Government's favoured benchmark.
When Iain Duncan Smith took over in 2001, Mr Howard was the surprise choice as shadow chancellor, where he swiftly consolidated his reputation as a forensic and powerful Commons performer.
This was as much a function of the terminal decline of the Major government, which Mr Howard came to epitomise, as a coherent critique of his achievements.     His earlier ministerial association with the poll tax - though his were not the only fingerprints at the scene - and the privatisation of water - now uncontroversial, then mightily divisive - contributed to the image.
Mr Howard's most draconian measures, the so-called "three strikes and you're out" provision for repeat burglars and mandatory sentences for serial drug traffickers, were actually enacted by Labour after 1997. Furthermore, the prison population has risen even faster under the current Government without its ministers attracting the same opprobrium.
If he becomes Tory leader, that substance will be sorely tested over the next two years.
It is a record for which a home secretary might in other circumstances expect congratulations. Mr Howard, however, merely endured brickbats.
It derives principally from his time as home secretary, when his insistence on tougher penalties for criminals offended the sensibilities of the liberals whose law and order policies had so palpably failed that the Tory government faced the gravest crime crisis in history.
