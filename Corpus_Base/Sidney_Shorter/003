That's the Fleur-Purpure -- a purple fleur-de-lys on a white roundel,
centered on a purple field -- and not only did they propose it in 218,
they kept it. You'll still see it flying in La Pen and Nouvelle-Anjou (I
saw it flying from a house in Trois Étoiles when I was there five
years ago).  It's become something of an unofficial flag for Franco-Davenportians. 
The PN (Parti Nationale) used to fly it at rallies and speeches all the
time, but they've cut back on that somewhat -- they're trying to avoid
alienating Western voters.

I saw an article yesterday about relations between Anglophone and Francophone
Davenportians which stated that the Francian settlers proposed their own
flag.  I've never seen this before; what flag was that?

There seems to be some confusion over when the flag was introduced.
Legend has it that Steve Wilson designed the First Flag on the same day
that he first carried it -- in the historic Street Vendors' Revolt (against
Angliyaan tax collectors) in Star City in 193.  However, purple banners
were favoured by independence advocates since the idea was first proposed
in the 180's, and for a very simple reason that had nothing to do with
nobility -- one of the few colours not represented in the multi-coloured
flags of Angliyaa and Francia (now part of Merité) was purple.

It's now believed that Sidney Shorter, a bureaucrat in Star City's colonial
government, first designed the Flag to display at secret Council meetings,
maybe as early as 191.  It was this flag that Wilson unfurled during
his historic march through the city.
