I writebecause I want to write.  I dont consider myself a good
storyteller, and I have no burning stories to tell.  I have no solutions
to the problems of the world.  I think there are solutions for individual
people and individual circumstances. My writing is my way of saying, Have
you looked at this way?  I do it.  I enjoy it.
Its a razzle-dazzle kind of fun to have a story come out and do well. 
Thats wonderful.  But its only when youre up there working when
its actually real: thats what the whole thing is rooted in, and thats
the only thing that actually counts.

For many years, she lived in Maryland and taught school, and now she lives

with a character and a slight plot, and after that, she begins to see the
theme.
