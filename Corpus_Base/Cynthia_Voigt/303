A book that can stand on its own as well as part of a series, and one that will be treasured by those who love thoughtful stories about real people.
Fine... 2004-04-26At first when I read this book, I was bored out of my wits. I had to read this book for a school project, which I really didn't want to do. I almost fell asleep during the first 50 pages of the book. But near the end, the plot got a lot better and I enjoyed it more. It was very interesting, but I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had read the first book in the Tillerman series. I had many questions, like- Why was the mother mentally ill? How did they get with Gram? etc. But his is a great book that pulls you into the story, especially at the very end. I know I put in 3 stars for this book, but I would rather have put in 3 and a half- I really enjoyed this.

Cynthia Voigt is also unusual among YA writers in her consistent development of the adult characters as complex and real; evading the trap of making them simply foils for the teen protagonist or a catalyst in the story.
The four Tillerman children finally have a home at their grandmother's rundown farm on the Maryland shore. It's what Dicey has dreamed of for her three younger siblings, but after watching over the others for so long, it's hard to let go. Who is Dicey, if she's no longer the caretaker for her family?
Dicey finds herself in new friends, in a growing relationship with her grandmother, and in the satisfaction of refinishing the old boat she found in the barn. Then, as Dicey experiences the trials and pleasures of making a new life, the past comes back with devastating force, and Dicey learns just how necessary -- and painful -- letting go can be.
