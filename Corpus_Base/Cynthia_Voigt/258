The book Dicey's Song was one of the most insighful books I have read having to deal with children's emotions and feelings. I read this book and some of the other books that deal with the Tillerman family and their friends for a college Bibliotherapy class. I could not put any of the books down once I started reading them. I thought that Cynthia did an excellent job portraying the emotions of an abandoned thirteen year old girl and the struggles she dealt with inwardly. I think that the book was very discriptive and well written when it came time for conversations among the family members. Cynthia did not lead me to believe that life is fine and merry for the Tillermans. They do face struggles but along with those struggle comes understanding and hope. I was very pleased with Cynthia's use of emtion throughout the book. It made the book one of those, "I can't put it down books." Well, the story is sad and emtional but there are little things along the way that bring a smile to your face and tell you that things will work out in the end. It is a fabulous must read book. :)
I loved this book and i couldn't put it down! It was very good but it was not the best of Cynthia Voigt's books. It was about a young girl whos mother abandoned her. I recomend it (along with her other books) to everyone!
