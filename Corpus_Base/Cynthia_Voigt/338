After you have finished 
    reading, please complete the following writing assignments.  
    Be careful to follow the directions.  Since an important

    is to be sure that each student understands his/her 
    assignments and completes each one carefully, a 
    clear “PURPOSE FOR WRITING” or “PFW” is provided 
    for every piece of writing assigned all year, and 
    summer reading is no exception.  The PFW must 
    be written completely at the top of each writing 
    assignment, and the significant information included 
    in it should be mentioned in the beginning and in 
    the conclusion of each piece of writing.  An example 
    is included.
