He won acclaim during the War of 1812 as brigadier-general in command of the frontier of northern New York. At the Battle of Plattsburg on September 11, 1814 with only 1,500 regular troops and some detachments of militia, he repulsed an invasion attempt by a greatly superior British force under Sir George Prevost. General Macomb was promoted major-general for his conduct at this battle, receiving both the thanks of Congress and a gold medal.


Macomb Family
When Major General Jacob Brown, the Army’s commanding general, died in February 1828, President John Quincy Adams could have chosen as Brown's successor one of the Army's two brigadier generals. But the two — Winfield Scott and Edmund P. Gaines — had denounced each other publicly and for months had been contesting for the position. Their quarrels scandalized the Army and drove Adams to nominate Alexander Macomb, the Chief of Engineers, who by then had reverted rank to colonel, as the Army’s top general.
Born in Detroit, Michigan, Macomb was the son of Alexander Macomb, Sr..
He died while in office in Washington, D.C. and is buried in the Congressional Cemetery.
Macomb County, Michigan is named after him.
