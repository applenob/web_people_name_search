    It is an invaluable tool for the reenactor who wishes to understand pre-war 
    tactics. The work is now complete.  I particularly recommend the Regulations 
    section, as a clear rendition of the essentials, particularly in posting guards 
    and sentinels.
In his younger years, in 1836, Cooper served as aide-de-camp 
    for Alexander Macomb, Commander of the U.S. Army.  Macomb was assigned the 
    task of compiling a volunteer and militia handbook, to simplify the manuals 
    then in use, and render the information understandable to the volunteer officer.  
    Macomb set his young aide to work on this task
