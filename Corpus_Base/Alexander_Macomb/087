One of the most talented and distinguished officers of the early United States Army, Alexander Macomb entered service in 1799 as a cornet of light dragoons. In 1802, he earned an appointment as a lieutenant in the newly-created Corps of Engineers. By 1809, when he sat for this portrait, he had served one year with major's rank, completing many significant fortifications, and he had prepared the first published court-martial manual for the army. Macomb commanded the 3rd Artillery Regiment at the outbreak of the War of 1812 and was promoted to brigadier general in January 1814. He is shown wearing an Engineer officers undress uniform.
Provenance: by descent in the Macomb-Whiting family to the late Thomas Nash Graham; purchased at the latter's estate sale in 1999.

For his gallant and distinguished service at the battle of Plattsburg, he was presented with a gold medal by Congress and was brevetted to major general. He became Chief of Engineers in 1821 and was promoted to major general and commander-in-chief in 1828, a position that he served with great merit until his death in 1841.
