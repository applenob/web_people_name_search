My Dear Mr. Burns - In the Macomb Journal, received this morning, I notice that the monument to General Macomb and Commodore McDonough is to be erected in the east part of the park, which meets with my hearty approval. I would have suggested that location, if anyone would have asked my advice as I am still, as always in the past, in favor of a better and beautiful Macomb. Please accept not only my thanks for your efforts, but also my congratulations for the consummation of your patriotic labors. Yours very truly, C.V. Chandler. Macomb Daily Journal, June 15, 1914.
