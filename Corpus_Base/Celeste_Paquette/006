Dr. Shankar Shetty, medical director at FAMU, also encourages students to take the vaccine, which costs about $75, because it may pay off in the long run. The expense, however, can deter some students, he said.
A new state law that goes into effect in January requires universities to provide students information on the two diseases, said medical officials at Florida State and Florida A&M universities.
She said all college students are at risk because of the "cluster living" of dorms and shared apartments. But it may be as simple as "a bad bug in the right space in the right time."
The current meningitis vaccine covers only four of the five strains of the disease, said Dr. Celeste Paquette, medical director at FSU. But over the past 10 years, the vaccine would have covered about 85 percent of the meningitis cases that occurred nationally, she said. Outbreak of the disease is rare but has occurred in Tallahassee.
Florida's university students will have to be vaccinated for meningitis or hepatitis B next year - or sign a waiver saying they refuse to do so.
The waiver also adds another layer of paperwork to the college registration process.
Said Shetty: "If they don't sign it, it will hold up their registration."
"If it were my kid, I'd give it to her in a heartbeat," Paquette said.
