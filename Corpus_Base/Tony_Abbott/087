Tony Abbott is funnier than Jacques Tati…

Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, agnostics, atheists: vote for the party you think has the ideas that are best for the future health of the country. Of course you will bring your values to that task, because it is impossible not to.
I would go further and suggest Rudd is not doing this as some kind of cunning political tactic; he is doing it because he believes the values he has derived from his reading of Christianity have something to offer all of us. He is doing it because he believes it is the right thing to do. He is doing it also with a realistic view of Australia as a secular pluralist society. He is not forcing his religion on anyone, but he is enacting values he has found, in part, through religion, but which others may have arrived at in other ways. We need a coalition of all those who share such values in order to expose the prevailing Howardite “political correctness” and what it has cost us.

That the Right has a monopoly on values, religious or otherwise, but including Christian values (since when has “Blessed are the rich” been one?), is a myth carefully nurtured by the Right but overdue for demolition. Rudd is hurting the Right because he knows how to do that.
Yes, in what reads like a stand-up comedy routine in Melbourne Tony Abbott has hit out at Kevin Rudd for using religion politically! Now Tony, John, Kevin Andrews — indeed no-one on THAT side of politics — would ever do such a thing, would they? Never ever! How dare Rudd suggest that Jesus did not vote Liberal!
Yes, Kevin Rudd has made no secret of his religious convictions. Let me recycle a post from October 2006. There I develop these ideas further:
Ignore Abbott’s unbelievably hypocritical political grandstanding.
