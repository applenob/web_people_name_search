Abbott: Don't reward Beattie
"I think these polls will cause people to think long and hard about whether they want to reward this kind of sustained ineptitude."
Mr Abbott played down the implications of the poll but said he hoped Queenslanders would carefully consider the Beattie government's record when they vote.

"I find it hard to believe that the people of Queensland will reward the kind of sustained ineptitude that we've seen in the Queensland public hospital system by returning the Beattie government.
Tony Abbott should look at himself and John Howard.  Obvisously Tony Abbot hasn't heard of the saying "people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones".  It just shows how arrogant Tony Abbott is.  Maybe we shouldn't reward either John Howard or Tony Abbot?   At least Peter Beattie has called an inquiry into the Dr. Death scandall.  It's a shame
that Tony Abbot and his friends will not widen the terms of reference for the AWB scandal.
Oh Damn ! Just when I was starting to think that the Queensland Lib/Nat team just might be a (marginal) option for my vote, in steps Tony Abbott to remind us of the Canberra mob and the churches and right-to-lifers who really run this country (down the tubes).
FEDERAL Health Minister Tony Abbott has warned Queenslanders they'll be rewarding "sustained ineptitude" if Labor is re-elected at next month's state poll.
The latest Newspoll gives Labor 52 per cent of the primary vote - a result that would allow the party to build on its 16 seat majority without having to rely on the preferences of minor parties.
"In the end the only poll that matters is the one of September 9," Mr Abbott told reporters.
