Lexus thinks Tony Abbott made a good mystery because it gave her a close idea of what's going to happen.  Syra thinks that this is a good book because Tony Abbott uses a lot of details and is a good mystery writer.  We like the part when Eric,Neal, and Julie took spoons and shot meatballs at the Ninns (the Ninns are monsters).
Syra recommends this book to everyone that likes mysteries because this book will put you in suspense.  Lexus recommends this book to  everyone that likes The Secrets of Droon series.  Lexus and Syra recommend this book to people all over the world who like Tony Abbott.
