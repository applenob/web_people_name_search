The author of three best-selling series for young readers, Tony Abbott didnt actually turn to writing full-time until 1994. He has always been involved with the world of writing, however, from his time at the University of Connecticut  where he graduated with a degree in English Literature  to his work with a variety of specialty bookstores, a university library, and an Internet book and magazine publisher. He shares a love of fantasy and adventure with his readers, with whom he maintains contact through his many school visits; Abbott has also taught writing workshops for all elementary grades.
Though he first came to attention with his Danger Guys series, begun in 1994,   Tony Abbott has continued to gain recognition for The Secrets of Droon, an ongoing   series that independent bookstores count in their top ten fantasy book recommendations   for Harry Potter fans. Abbotts books have been translated into Spanish,   Italian, and Korean, and nearly two million copies have been sold worldwide.
An avid tennis player, Abbott is a fan of the films of Preston Sturges and the Marx Brothers. He enjoys the writings of P. G. Wodehouse, James Thurber, S. J. Perelman, and Raymond Chandler. He was born in Cleveland, Ohio, but now lives in Connecticut. Abbott is married and has two daughters.
