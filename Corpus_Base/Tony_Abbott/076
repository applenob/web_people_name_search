The Foundation values the relationship with the Minister and looks forward to continuing engagement particularly in regard to its forthcoming ‘Australia Unlimited’ program.
The Minister spoke in terms of the prevention of disease, encouragement of wellness and Federal/State responsibilities in relation to the health of the workforce and cooperation between all parties in achieving this.


The afternoon provided an excellent opportunity for our members to hear from the Minister his perceptions about the long term challenges facing the health care system in Australia. It also provided an excellent basis for future dialogue between the Foundation and his Department.
