Tony Abbott’s Love Child - Not His!
Just occasionally I am tempted by anonymity.
Who the fuck saw that coming eh? (Jesus I feel all Canadian all of a sudden)
Now I know I am REALLY going to hell for this remark, but if I was Tony I’d get his other kids DNA tested.
I reckon its all pretty Zen really - Abbott’s just getting what is coming his way after the shameless way he manipulated this whole story.
I just love the detail that Kathy D practiced contraception on her one night stand with a fellow housemate (true in this case) but didn’t with Tony, and guess which one produced the sprog?
Tony Abbott is the best damn politician in this country. I consider him a wonderful and beautiful person, who in a better world, would excel to the highest offices of this land. But you heathen scum prefer to mock this enlightened, magnificent man with scorn and ham-fisted foolery. I spit on thee!
Makes me wonder about the true nature of her relationship with the Monk
I saw Tony Abbott on the television just now and I almost felt compassion for him.
It’s all very Ricki Lake.. with the DNA testing.
BTW - I’m amazed by Kathy Donnelly’s story - I’ve had sex a number of times myself, and I cant recall it ever being quite as accidental as she makes it sound and I’m pretty sure that it needed the active participation of both parties.
Yeah - there are a few karmic overtones to this whole thing aren’t there.  Maybe Tony Abbott will now become the Mad Buddhist Monk.  Then he can study the Noble Eightfold Path of Commonwealth State funding arrangements.
I love Tony Abbott.
Seems Abbott should have done some DNA testing before throwing some poor guy into the limelight for his own political gain.
I feel dirty…
I choked on my beer when Tony said that he and Kathy are “still good friends”, I mean, she made him look like such a gullible ass.  Is there no end to Abbott’s insincerity?
Can you imagine the phone call between Abbott and Kathy?
