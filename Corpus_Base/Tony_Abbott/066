Abbott optimistic about cervical cancer vaccination plan
CSL has been asked to provide more details of the drug and its price to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.
After initially saying the immunisations could not be subsidised until 2008, Mr Abbott is now more optimistic.
Federal Health Minister Tony Abbott is offering hope that cervical cancer immunisations could begin in Australian schools next year after all.

"If a decision can be made this year, I am reasonably confident that we could roll out the program next year," he said.
"Tony Abbott originally wasn't going to do anything about this vaccine, he was just going to stand back," she said.
More talks with CSL are scheduled for later this week.

Labor health spokeswoman Julia Gillard fears that to cut costs the Government will only offer a subsidised vaccination to school-age girls, and not 19- to 26-year-olds.
"If the vaccine is effective for women up to the age of 26, then it needs to be available to all women in that age range," she said.
The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has restarted meetings with the vaccine's manufacturers, CSL.
"The ball is now in CSL's court but I think they know that the Government regards this as an important public health issue and we would like to resolve it in time to have a national vaccination program next year," Mr Abbott said.
"It was the Prime Minister that finally got him moving and now it seems he's changed position again and said the vaccine will be available in 2007."
She says Mr Abbott is backing down after originally listing 2008 as the earliest start date.
