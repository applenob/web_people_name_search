Characteristics of ADEPT collections:


A collection of resources collected for a certain purpose.

In this case, they are collection geomorphic information. Even if the subject
and keywords do not contain geomorphology, (eg dem's) any item collection
should
be associated with this collection.

once this collection is finished, then someone needs to go though and build the
"semantic" map for the collection. These resources were collected
with a certain
topic an project in mind, how do they realate together.

Step 2:  Identify
Characteristics/steps of learning:
It has generally been found that people perform better with
relations that can be visualized and there’s both a spatial representation
theory of reasoning and a subsequent semantic theory.  Mayer has a classic book on this subject (Revlin & Mayer,
1974).

Generality -
Definition (attributes, relationships)
Reasoning is closely related to problem-solving and involves
both concept formation (inductive reasoning) and deductive reasoning (logical
argument).

Put in stuff here about concept learning such as their

Step 6: How can these learning concepts define an ADEPT
educational collection and be modeled in the collections and services for a DL
of educational users?
Step 1:
Identify definitions of collections as per project – discussed at Collections
Meetings (01/31 and 02/14) with the diagrams below.
Step 4: Investigate and propose the use of a theory (for
example, Component Display Theory, Roberts’ model, etc. is used below), and
specify the following minimum characteristics of an “exemplar”
teaching/learning ADEPT collection:

Dave V’s definition:
1) Errors in concept formation are: overgeneralization,
undergeneralization, and misconception

“If the generality was presented by an explanation or
illustration, followed by practice examples, this would be an expository
strategy (EG,Eeg). On the other hand, if the students were required to discover
the generality on the basis of practice examples, this would be an inquisitory
strategy (IG, Ieg). “
