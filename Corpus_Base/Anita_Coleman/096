Some dLIST features are:
dLIST is a cross-institutional, subject-based, open access digital archive for the Information Sciences, including Archives and Records Management, Library and Information Science, Information Systems, Museum Informatics, and other critical information infrastructures. The dLIST vision is to serve as a trusted archive and source for scholarly communication in the Information Sciences, broadly understood. dLIST seeks to positively impact and shape scholarly communication in our closely related fields.  Editors represent diverse sub-disciplinary communities and work closely with scholars in different fields such as Digital Humanities and Digital Libraries (Marija Dalbello), Government Information and Social Informatics (Kristin Eschenfelder), Information Behaviors (Soo Young Rieh), Museum Informatics (Paul Marty), Scholarly Communication (Charles Bailey), Science Technology Studies (Fernando Elichirigoity), and Classics (Michael May).  More information about each of the dLIST editors is available at http://dlist.sir.arizona.edu/editors.html.
We are pleased to announce the dynamic new team of editors for dLIST, the Digital Library of Information Science & Technology.  These Information/Library & Information Science faculty and librarians will be
responsible for specific subjects.
The new team invites you to self-register, self-archive and explore the many unique features of dLIST.
