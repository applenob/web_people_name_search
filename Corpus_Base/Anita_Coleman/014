Information Resources - University of Arizona, Tucson) - dLIST Editor
Anita has been helping dLIST grow organically since 2002. 
Sponsored and helped by SIG-DL and the panelists, she organized the Competing 
Information Realities: 
Digital Libraries, Digital Repositories and the Commons panel/technical
session. How do our communities practice open access? 
Open Access (OA) is clearly of great interest and valued by our field. 
We're also cautiously 
and innovatively beginning to play with repository technologies, 
open access archives and practice self-archiving. But we can do 
more if we harness our efforts to strategically leverage OA for  
the Information Sciences.
