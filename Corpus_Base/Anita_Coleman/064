Postings vary widely: news items pertinent to librarians, relevant  conference presentations, and other blogs or resources about open  access developed by librarians.  The latest posting is the  announcement about EBSCO's making LISTA OA - thanks to Buddy  Pennington and other ERIL-L people for the tip!

Under OA Resources on the right-hand side of the page, you'll find  links to free open access resources in Library and Information  Science: the LIS journals listed in the Directory of Open Access  Journals, and two open archives for LIS: E-LIS and D-LIST. There are  also links to bibliographies and advocacy tools.

OA Librarian is a new, cooperatively produced weblog, which combines  a pathfinder function with news and commentary on open access and  librarianship.  Please visit us here: http://oalibrarian.blogspot.com/
One theme of OA Librarian is highlighting the work of OA librarian  advocates. Thus far we have focused on Antonella de Robbio, the  originator of E-LIS; Anita Coleman, the driving force behind DLIST;  and Charles W. Bailey, Jr., the author of the Open Access  Bibliography: Liberating Scholarly Literature with E-Prints and Open  Access Journals.
