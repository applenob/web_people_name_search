The 
                judges will now have to decide. But with the enormous bad luck 
                he had, there is also a tiny bit of good news: Mr Ziebkard did 
                win the amount of 153 Marks, and no computer error there.
This 
                is Alfred Schroeder in Bonn for AM.
The 
                case is now before a Dusseldorf court, where Mr Zeibkard's lawyer 
                argued it was not his client's fault that the computer went haywire. 
                It was his right to withdraw money from his bank account and spend 
                it. The Lotto company's lawyer charged he had been negligent, 
                he had not compared his Lotto ticket with the winning numbers, 
                and was thus not authorised to accept one single Mark.
