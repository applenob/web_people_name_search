Documents provide information about the Schroeders, focusing on Fred Schroeder's various business interests: land leasing, development, and farming; banking and other financial dealings; cottonseed oil production; and a hot mineral wells health resort. The papers illuminate not only Fred Schroeder's individual business affairs, but also those of his numerous partnerships with various members of the Henry Hollmann, Sr., family, as well as with other businessmen in the South Texas counties of Bee, Goliad, Karnes, Nueces, and Refugio. Other materials concern personal matters of Fred, wife Katherine, and daughter Hulda. Much of the personal, as well as some business, correspondence is in German, for which annotations are provided. Because Fred Schroeder's business and personal relationships were not always mutually exclusive and the financial transactions were often complex, there is some overlap among the series and subseries.
