This past Saturday, we had a new arrival.  My wife and I welcomed our second daughter,  Ava Marie Powell at 8:49AM.  She weighed in at 5lb even and was 18.5 inches long.  This is huge compared to our first daughter, Nora (3yrs old), who was born at 3lb 3oz!
Nora is running around telling anyone who will listen that she's the big sister.  Mom and baby are home and doing well, so it's back to work for me.
