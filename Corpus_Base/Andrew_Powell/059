Andrew Powell's name is synonymous with some of the finest contemporary
albums released in the UK over the last two decades. Studying music at King's
College, Cambridge, Powell was determined that his route was to get involved in
contemporary electronic music and while still at Cambridge he was a founding
member together with Roger Smalley and Tim Souster, of the live electronic
group Intermodulation, which gave several performances in the UK of works by
Stockhausen.
A busy man, he has scored and produced many film soundtracks, including
Caravan To Vaccares, Ladyhawke and Rocket Gibraltar.
He subsequently played with several London orchestras, including Covent
Garden, the London Symphony Orchestra, The London Philharmonic Orchestra and,
mainly, the BBC Symphony Orchestra with Peter Boulez, while also working as a
session player. Powell made his first mark in contemporary rock when he was
employed as arranger of Cockney Rebel's debut album, and subsequently met Alan
Parsons when he produced their second album! He subsequently played on albums
by Leo Sayer, Donovan, John Miles (the fantastic orchestral score on
"Music" is his!), Cliff Richard, Pilot, Al Stewart, Mick Fleetwood,
Chris Rea and Muenchener Freiheit among many others. As a producer, he took the
credits on Kate Bush's first two albums, "The Kick Inside" and
"Lionheart". He also produced Elaine Paige, Chris DeBurgh, rock band
Kansas, Tim Rice, Mari Wilson and Judi Collins.
