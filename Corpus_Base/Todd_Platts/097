A mini golf fundraiser was sponsored by the Allegheny-Kiski
                    Valley Chapter on June 1. More than 70 people, young and
                    old, played in the 18-hole event. The chapter raised over
                    $2,000, for a charity to be named in the future. League
                    directors Lanny Horn, John Gulick and John Richards were
                    among the attendees, along with League Development
                    Consultant Monika Scott.
Among the 300 people attending the
                    fundraiser luncheon were Congressmen Phil English, Joe
                    Pitts, Todd Platts, Don Sherwood and, of course, Gekas.
                    League staff attending included: Jim McCormack, League
                    President/CEO; Jan Hartman, Vice President, Governmental
                    Affairs; and Christina Dunn, Governmental Affairs
                    Specialist. The staff had the opportunity to speak with
                    Congressman Gekas, as well as Representatives Joe Pitts and
                    Todd Platts.
When targeting age groups, the study recommends that you
                    further segment by marital status and presence of children,
                    to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of your
                    marketing campaign. Using age alone, the researchers found,
                    has significant shortcomings because age segmentation may
                    mask large differences within age groups.
Bedekovic replaced James Kauffman Jr.,
                    who resigned to become Vice President of Compliance for
                    Household International in Chicago. Currently serving as the
                    departments Deputy Secretary for Depository Financial
                    Institutions, Bedekovic is Acting Secretary, pending her
                    Senate confirmation.
The Pennsylvania Credit Union Foundation
                    continues to lead the way in Major Gifts Fundraising
                    Activities. Its annual Arts Expo and Raffle continues to be
                    a model for marketing the Foundation, as well as a valuable
                    fund raising tool. It is also apparent that the Foundation
                    continues to provide a greater number of grants to its
                    constituency than do other Foundations at this stage.
The bill is expected to be voted on by the State Senate
                    in the coming weeks. This measure is intended to help offset
                    the budget shortfall that is being faced by state lawmakers.
Bob Macey, Marketing Manager for Century Heritage FCU

The Lan-Chester Chapter awarded three $500
                    scholarships for the Penn State School in August. They were
                    awarded to: Chuck Jackson, Keystone FCU; Renee Leaman,
                    Wheatland FCU; and Jacquelyn Dana Thomas, Citadel
                    FCU.
Pennsylvania Central FCU, Harrisburg, is offering a
                    $1,000 scholarship again this year. All high school
                    graduates, who are members, are eligible to apply for the
                    scholarship award by preparing a typed 300-word essay on the
                    topic, "What should a young adult expect from a
                    financial institution and why?"
"Fran Bedekovic has an impressive
                    background in the banking industry, starting as a teller
                    fresh out of college, then working her way up to become a
                    sales manager, commercial lender and eventually a senior
                    vice president," Gov. Schweiker said. "Fran knows
                    and understands the needs of Pennsylvanias financial
                    institutions and their customers. Her experience in the
                    banking industry and her dedication to the Commonwealth will
                    serve her well in this new position."
Gekas faces a challenge from Democratic
                    U.S. Rep. Tim Holden, who is seeking a fifth term, in the
                    November 5 general election. Holden is now part of the newly
                    redrawn 17th District in central Pennsylvania, which has
                    been served by Gekas. The luncheon raised $200,000,
                    including money contributed by supporters who did not attend
                    the event.
Vice President Dick Cheney was in
                    Harrisburg on Friday, June 7 to lend his support to U.S.
                    Rep. George Gekas re-election bid. During the fundraiser
                    luncheon, Cheney devoted much of his 20-minute speech to
                    President Bushs efforts to improve security in the
                    aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks.
With the kids out of school and families now making
                    summer vacation a priority, the credit union expects to be
                    quite busy processing vacation loans in the weeks ahead.
                    "Credit union members have come to depend on our
                    special promotions," said Amato.

LANCO FCU, Lancaster, held a month-long fundraiser
                    for Childrens Miracle Network (CMN). Each Friday in May,
                    rolls of Lifesavers were given out to any member who donated
                    to CMN. The Lifesavers were wrapped with a LANCO sticker
                    that read "I am a Lifesaver, I donated to CMN!"
                    The credit union raised $300.
The following credit unions recently signed contracts for
                    programs that will help expand services to their members:
                    Freedom United FCU, Certegy EFD; West York Area
                    School District Employees FCU, CUCheck Card; and Wilkes-Barre
                    Postal FCU, Platinum Card.
"Our loan officers and marketing department are
                    extremely busy promoting and preparing our members for
                    summer fun with our Aloha Loan Special," according to
                    Amy Amato, Marketing Representative.
The network facilitates communication,
                    creates and fosters partnerships and defines the role of
                    development through the sharing of resources among its
                    member organizations. The meeting provides Foundations with
                    an opportunity to network with one another and exchange
                    marketing materials. It combined peer presentations and
                    facilitated discussions, with topics ranging from marketing
                    and fundraising ideas, to regulations and foundation
                    accounting.
The NCUF, through the Ohio Foundation,
                    issued a legal manual that provides the legal framework for
                    the establishment and the operation of a Foundation. Its
                    contents can be used as a legal reference to all fundraising
                    and grants-making activities.
Joe Wambach, Executive Director of the
                    Pennsylvania Credit Union Foundation, found the discussions
                    far more sophisticated than in the past. "The session
                    provided the most definitive accounting and regulatory
                    information Ive ever seen. This will assure that State
                    Foundations are run efficiently and properly. I cant wait
                    to see what the next meeting will be like," Wambach
                    said.
Ready or not, its time for a vacation and Penn East
                    Federal Credit Union in Scranton is helping to get its
                    members off to their vacation getaways.
A flyer has been designed to promote the credit unions

                    union Visa card at the fixed rate of 10.25 percent APR, they
                    will receive an additional one-half percent off the low
                    vacation loan rate.

The State Senate Appropriations Committee voted
                    unanimously on June 4 to report Senate Bill 1222, the State
                    Credit Union Parity Bill, out of committee. At Keystone
                    Extra press-time, the bill was awaiting a full Senate
                    vote.
A bill that would change the amount of time necessary to
                    declare property in financial institutions abandoned is
                    moving towards passage in Harrisburg. Senate Bill 1366,
                    sponsored by Senator Joe Conti, would reduce the amount of
                    time from seven years to five years before unclaimed
                    property held by financial institutions would be transferred
                    to the State Treasury.

"We are very pleased by the unanimous vote in the
                    Appropriations Committee and continue to ask credit unions
                    to contact their State Senators to urge a favorable vote on
                    the Senate floor," said Jan Hartman, League Vice
                    President of Governmental Affairs. The bill allows state
                    chartered credit unions to petition the Secretary of Banking
                    for field of membership, powers or credit union service
                    organizations as allowed by the Federal Credit Union Act.
Twenty-six people representing 16 state
                    foundations and the National Credit Union Foundation (NCUF)
                    spent time in Hershey, June 5-7, networking with one another
                    at the State Credit Union Foundation Network meeting. The
                    meeting, hosted by the Pennsylvania Credit Union League, was
                    opened by League President/CEO Jim McCormack.
The study examines the various aspects that define
                    financial service needs among households in which the head
                    is between the ages of 35 and 64 and is the second of four
                    studies on life cycling marketing for credit unions
                    published by the Filene Research Institute.
Gov. Mark Schweiker nominated Frances A.
                    Bedekovic of Mechanicsburg, Cumberland County, to be
                    Secretary of the Department of Banking, effective June 5.
The Banking Department regulates
                    Pennsylvania state-chartered banks, non-depository trust
                    companies, savings and loan associations, and credit unions.
                    The department also licenses more than 12,000 non-depository
                    financial services companies making or brokering various
                    types of consumer loans.
Members visiting the credit union are greeted with
                    colorful posters and palm tree decals that decorate the
                    lobby and remind them of this seasonal promotion. The credit
                    unions SEGs have been pro-vided with flyers and statement
                    stuffers promoting the loan special. Ads were also placed in
                    local publications that serve groups within the credit unions
                    field of membership.
Citadel FCU, Thorndale, recently awarded $1,000

                    Cycle Marketing for Credit Unions: Mid Age Households,
                    suggests that credit unions dont do enough to segment
