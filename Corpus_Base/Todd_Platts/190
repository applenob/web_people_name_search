Leadership through retaliation is no way for the House to do business, Simon said. Such tactics will only make the American people even more distrustful and cynical of Congress.

Common Cause protests the actions taken last week by the Republican House leadership that, according to recent published reports, punished fellow GOP Members who supported the Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform legislation last year.
It is flatly wrong to punish Members because they support reform, and have the courage to fight for their convictions, said Don Simon, acting president of Common Cause, which spearheaded efforts to pass the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA). Americans elect their representatives to vote their conscience and do whats right   not whats politically expedient for party leaders.

Others were apparently punished as well.  According to published reports, three GOP members who signed a discharge petition that forced BCRA to a vote on the House floor over the objection of the leadership were reportedly passed over for more prominent committee assignments they sought.  Rep. Robert Simmons (R-CT) did not get a seat on the Appropriations Committee, Rep. Todd Platts (R-PA) was passed over for the Armed Services Committee and Charles Bass (R-N.H.) was denied a spot on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

The most blatant example of this punishment is the case of Rep. Chris Shays (R-CT), who co-sponsored the campaign finance reform legislation in the House. Shays, an eight-term congressman, was in line to become the next chairman of the House Government Reform Committee. But the House leadership instead chose Rep. Tom Davis (R-VA), a five-term Member -- and a key party fund-raiser.
