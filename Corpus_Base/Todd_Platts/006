Finally, I want to publicly thank my family, friends, and countless supporters who give so tirelessly to my campaign. I am humbled by the support of so many fine people. I look forward to the coming campaign.
Dear Friend:
Sincerely,Todd Russell PlattsU.S. Congressman19th District, Pennsylvania
With the 2004 General Election upon us, I am honored to seek re-election to Congress. Representing the citizens of Adams, Cumberland, and York counties has been a true honor for which I am deeply grateful. As Congress has debated critical issues such as national and economic security, I have done my utmost to fulfill the trust and confidence that the citizens of the 19th District have placed in me.
If you are interested in helping out with my campaign, please call 717-846-1901 or 717-880-0650. Thank you for your help!
As in my previous campaigns, I plan to conduct an aggressive, grass-roots campaign focused on the issues facing our great Nation. I will continue to refuse special interest contributions from political action committees (PACs). The People for Platts Committee will raise campaign funds from personal contributions only and will depend on volunteers to help spread my positive message. We will be again be campaigning door-to-door throughout the district this fall. I remain dedicated to "Putting People First. Always!"
