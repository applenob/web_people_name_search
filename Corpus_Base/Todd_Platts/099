Congressman Todd Platts is with us -- there he is. (Applause.) His mother made me some peanut butter fudge. (Laughter.) She expects me to eat it on the bus ride. (Laughter.) I don't know. But, anyway, tell her thanks for the fudge. (Laughter.)
What a fine job Congressman Todd Platts is doing for the people of this area. (Applause.) Where's your mother? There's mom, right there. She made me some fudge. (Laughter.) I'm going to run all day -- well, I'm going to bike all day tomorrow. (Laughter.) Thanks for the fudge, I actually had some.
