With the 2004 Primary Election fast approaching, I am pleased to inform you of my
decision to seek re-election to Congress. Representing the citizens of Adams,
Cumberland, and York counties has been a true honor for which I am deeply grateful.
As Congress has debated critical issues such as national and economic security,
I have done my utmost to fulfill the trust and confidence that the citizens of the
19th District have placed in me.
As in my previous campaigns, I plan to conduct an aggressive, grass-roots campaign
focused on the issues facing our great Nation. I will continue to refuse special
interest contributions from political action committees (PACs). The People for Platts
Committee will raise campaign funds from personal contributions only and will depend
on volunteers to help spread my positive message. I remain dedicated to "Putting
People First. Always!"
Finally, I want to publicly thank my family, friends, and countless supporters who
give so tirelessly to my campaign. I am humbled by the support of so many fine people.
I look forward to the coming campaign.
Sincerely,

Todd Russell Platts
U.S. Congressman
19th District, Pennsylvania
