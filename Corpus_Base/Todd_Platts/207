April 16, 2004 - Representatives Richard Burr (R-N.C.) 
                    and Sherwood Boehlert (R-N.Y.) continue to seek signatures 
                    on a House Republicans-only letter urging Budget Committee 
                    Chairman Jim Nussle (R-Iowa) to remove reconciliation instructions 
                    to the Energy and Commerce Committee that are currently outlined 
                    in the Budget Resolution. The reconciliation instructions 
                    require spending cuts of $2.2 billion over five years, and 
                    could likely result in significant cuts to Medicaid.
