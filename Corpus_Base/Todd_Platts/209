Mayor Brenner is right about 911; and why is Platts so shy about his $500K house?
Actually, it's good to see so much interest in city public service.
So why is he so defensive about the purchase, declining to comment to a reporter and claiming his new home was not a legitimate news story?
Could it be because living in a half-million-dollar house undercuts his "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" image?
Good for him. Moving up in the world is the American dream.
At least Platts will face some competition from third-party candidates: Libertarian Mickey Paoletta, Constitution Party candidate Lester Searer, and possibly a Green Party hopeful as well.

Next stop ... White House? Somebody better put up some heavyweight competition for Rep. Todd Platts if they ever want any hope of unseating him  before he establishes a Goodling-like dynasty.

	In fact, the House of Platts is already on the rise.

	Platts recently purchased a $525,000 house in Spring Garden Township  one street away from Wyndham Hills, the official high-society neighborhood of York County.

Judging from the heated rhetoric, though, you'd think we were just a few months away from elections for those offices  rather than the upcoming federal and state elections. Yorkers won't be voting for a new mayor and council members for some 14 months.
But first elections first, eh? And let's look at the top of the local tickets: The county's Democratic Party failed to muster a candidate to challenge Republican U.S. Rep. Todd Platts  an embarrassing lapse.
Yet we already have a possible slew of candidates for mayor  Brenner, city school board president Jeff Kirkland, possibly Anibal Santiago, possibly others. And now the grassroots political groups New Directions for the City of York is trying to recruit candidates for council and mayor.
