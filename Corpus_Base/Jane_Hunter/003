Hunter’s Wines have won more than 100 gold medals at national and international wine competitions, including the Marquis de Goulaine Trophy for Best Sauvignon Blanc in the World at the 1992 International Wine & Spirit Competition. More recently, the 2001 Sauvignon Blanc received gold medals at both the Hotel Grand Chancellor Royal Hobart Wine Show and at the 2002 Sydney International Wine competition where it was placed in the top 100 wines of the competition. The Hunter’s 1999 Chardonnay was also awarded gold in the same international wine competition in Sydney.
Since those early years Jane has been owner, viticulturist and managing director of what has become one of New Zealand’s most established wineries, Hunter’s Wines. Under her expertise, the original vineyard area has increased by 2.5 times its original size and the company’s annual output has grown to around 60,000 cases of wine, nearly half of which is exported.

In the last 20 years the province of Marlborough has moved from virtual obscurity to become New Zealand’s largest and best-known wine region with a reputation for producing some of the world’s finest sauvignon blanc. This huge potential was something that was recognised back in 1983 by Jane Hunter and her late husband Ernie when they founded their first fledgling winery in the picturesque Wairau Valley.
