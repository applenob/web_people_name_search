Although digitization is ideal for sharing, exchanging, 
		educating and preserving indigenous cultures, it also creates ample opportunities 
		for illicit access to and misuse of traditional knowledge. It is essential 
		that traditional owners be able to define and control the rights and access 
		to their resources, in order to uphold traditional laws; prevent the misuse 
		of indigenous heritage in culturally inappropriate or insensitive ways; 
		and receive proper compensation for their cultural and intellectual property. 
		Finally, it is essential that indigenous communities be able to describe 
		and contextualize their culturally and historically significant collections 
		in their own words and from their own perspectives.
This section describes the architecture of the software 
		system, its separate components and the overall process/workflow described 
		in Figure 1.

Abstract
XrML, eXtensible rights Markup Language, <http://www.xrml.org>
The remainder of this paper describes the software which 
		has been developed to support the requirements specified above. h1 class 
		= SubHeader>System Architecture and Components
Because of the enormous diversity of indigenous cultures, 
		the system has been designed so that it can easily be customized to support 
		the unique requirements of specific communities. The immediate future 
		involves working closely with a small number of indigenous communities 
		to refine the software to suit their specific requirements and projects. 
		Eventually we hope to make the software downloadable from the Internet 
		and freely available to indigenous communities for non-profit use and 
		to provide training in its use and maintenance.
Software Tools for Indigenous Knowledge Management
Using multimedia technologies, indigenous groups have been 
		able to record and preserve significant aspects of their cultures including 
		languages (First Voices), ceremonies, dances, songs, stories, symbols, 
		design, artwork, tools, costumes, historical photographs, film, videos 
		and audio tapes (NMAI, Barani, Diwurruwurru). Documentation of indigenous 
		knowledge and history has become an extremely important tool to ensure 
		the survival and self-sustainability of indigenous tribes and cultures, 
		and to provide evidence of past injustices and to support claims of original 
		ownership.
The work described here began with an investigation of the 
		ability of current and evolving information technology tools for rights 
		management (e.g., frameworks, markup languages, metadata models and standards) 
		to support the unique needs of indigenous communities. We found that initiatives 
		such as MPEG-21 (Multimedia Delivery Framework) (MPEG-21) and XrML (XrML) 
		are primarily concerned with e-commerce and protecting the commercial 
		rights of content owners. They are built on the premise of modern intellectual 
		property law regimes and the notions of individual property ownership 
		for a limited duration, ideas which are alien and detrimental to indigenous 
		cultures. MPEG-21 and XrML do not support the specific requirements expressed 
		by indigenous communities who need to protect indigenous knowledge or 
		enforce tribal customary laws.

The Descriptive Metadata consists of Dublin Core [Dublin] 
		plus some additional optional elements from the CIDOC CRM [CIDOC] for 
		describing physical museum objects, such as material, technique and dimensions. 
		Figure 4 shows the user interface for inputting or editing descriptive 
		metadata. Alternatively, some or all of the descriptive metadata could 
		be acquired from existing museum/library/archive database cataloguing 
		information.

No single approach is applicable to the repatriation of 
		indigenous information, knowledge and/or artefacts. For example, Australian 
		law differs from US law, and additionally, each tribal community will 
		have its own unique needs and requests. In the United States, while the 
		Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) specifies 
		the types of objects and sites to be protected and/or repatriated, it 
		is expected that some tribal communities will want access to the records 
		of all objects in museum collections associated with their community and 
		be satisfied with digital surrogates and access to physical objects when 
		requested. Going beyond the requirements of NAGPRA, the NMAI has established 
		a Culturally Sensitive Collections Care Program to respond to areas of 
		concern of Native peoples with regard to the maintenance, presentation, 
		and disposition of sensitive materials and information in the collections 
		of the museum. Jim Pepper Henry, Assistant Director for Community Services 
		at NMAI says:
The work described in this paper has been carried 
		out as part of a Queensland Smithsonian fellowship, funded by the Queensland 
		Government and a collaboration between the Distributed Systems Technology 
		Centre and the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian Cultural 
		Resources Centre (NMAI CRC). Thanks also to Angelina Russo and students 
		from UQ’s Information Environments program for their Web search 
		interface design.
In addition to the metadata which is explicitly saved to 
		the database through the user interface, meta-metadata is also recorded 
		- all changes to the metadata, who was responsible, and the date/time 
		of the changes are recorded within the database. This represents an important 
		component of the system's built-in security framework.

Figure 2  System Architecture and Workflow
Staff at the NMAI CRC also expressed the need to be able 
		to document traditional care information associated with culturally significant 
		physical artefacts in their custody. Kristina Dunman has described the 
		meaning and importance of traditional care of American Indian artefacts 
		in (Dunman). Jim Pepper Henry (Repatriation Program Manager at the NMAI) 
		also provided the following list of traditional care constraints frequently 
		requested by American Indian tribal representatives regarding the storage 
		and handling of objects:
A search, browse and retrieval interface to the collection 
		was built using standard Web Browser technologies (Internet Explorer, 
		Netscape) for the user interface. The advantages of using standard Browsers 
		for the search interface are their familiarity and widespread availability 
		and the lack of re-engineering necessary should collections eventually 
		be disseminated over wider networks. To access the collection, users must 
		have been allocated a login ID and password and a user profile. The steps 
		below illustrate the typical procedure which users would follow when searching 
		and browsing an indigenous collection:
Figure 1  Envisaged Software Usage Scenario
Figures 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, and 5e show the user 
		interface for defining access restrictions which depend on the user’s 
		tribal affiliation, gender, role and status.
Figure 11 - Search Results
Users require a login ID and password to run this software 
		component and, depending on their privileges/user profile, may only be 
		permitted access to certain functionality.
This component of the system enables users to input the 
		descriptive, rights and tribal care metadata associated with the objects 
		(either physical or digital) and to attach spoken or written annotations 
		to specific objects.

Saved metadata is stored in relational tables in a MySQL 
		database which is connected through a JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) 
		API [Java]. It is envisaged that, because of the sensitivity of the data, 
		this database will not be accessible through the Internet. It will be 
		stored on CD-ROM or the hard disk of a stand-alone supervised workstation, 
		within a cultural centre, keeping place or supervised building (such as 
		a library or a school) within the community.

		Queensland, Australia; and Jane Sledge, Smithsonian National Museum of

Similar traditional care recommendations also apply to culturally 
		sensitive artefacts belonging to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
		communitiesbut held in museums, archives, cultural centres and keeping 
		places.
Indigenous communities are beginning to realize the 
		potential benefits digital technologies can offer with regard to the documentation 
		and preservation of their histories and cultures. However, they are also 
		coming to understand the opportunities for knowledge misuse and misappropriation 
		of their knowledge which may accompany digitization. In this paper we 
		describe a set of open source software tools designed to enable indigenous 
		communities to protect unique cultural knowledge and materials preserved 
		through digitization. The software tools described here enable authorized 
		members of communities to define and control the rights, accessibility 
		and reuse of their digital resources; uphold traditional laws pertaining 
		to secret/sacred knowledge or objects; prevent the misuse of indigenous 
		heritage in culturally inappropriate or insensitive ways; ensure proper 
		attribution to the traditional owners; and enable indigenous communities 
		to describe their resources in their own words. Hopefully the deployment 
		of such tools will contribute to the self-determination and empowerment 
		of indigenous communities through the revitalization of their cultures 
		and knowledge which colonization, western laws, western cultures and globalization 
		have eroded.

In an earlier paper (Hunter), specific extensions to XrML, 
		in the form of customary constraints were developed to support the description 
		of customary or traditional laws which commonly affect access. An analysis 
		of tribal laws across Aboriginal and Native American communities revealed 
		the following common factors or variables which may determine access to 
		traditional knowledge:
Given a positive response from the community trials, we 
		plan to make the software freely available and downloadable from the Internet 
		for non-profit use by indigenous communities and to provide training in 
		the usage, refinement and maintenance of the system to interested groups.

Where possible, the specified access restrictions will be 
		enforced by matching them against the profile of the user. Every user 
		of the system requires a login ID and password. When being allocated a 
		user ID, users will also need to provide supporting documentation to prove 
		their claims of tribal affiliation, status, etc.

MPEG-21 Overview, <http://mpeg.telecomitalialab.com/standards/mpeg-21/mpeg-21.htm>
In response to a request from both museum staff and representatives 
		of Indigenous communities, we have also added support for the specification 
		of Tribal Care recommendations. The Tribal Care metadata tool enables 
		Indigenous communities to define the ways in which culturally significant 
		or sensitive physical artefacts should be treated - ways which are acceptable 
		to the cultures represented. Elders are able to define particular spatial 
		orientation, storage and preservation recommendations to ensure the respectful 
		tribal care of physical artefacts. While the actual implementation of 
		traditional care specifications may be difficult, many museums are attempting 
		to integrate Indigenous beliefs and requests into museum practices, and 
		our software will hopefully facilitate this process.
Figure 7 - Tribal Care Specifications
Because of the enormous diversity of indigenous cultures, 
		the system has been designed so that it can easily be customized to support 
		the unique requirements of different communities. Customization is carried 
		out through the SchemaManager tool. Community elders can add new constraints, 
		or remove or refine existing constraints, depending on the traditional 
		laws of their community. An XML Schema [XML] is saved to reflect their 
		particular metadata requirements and rights constraints, and the user 
		interface is then generated from the saved/selected schema. Figure 9 illustrates 
		the Schema Manager user interface.
National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI), <http://www.nmai.si.edu/>
In this paper we have investigated the application of IT 
		security mechanisms to the rights management of indigenous collections. 
		In consultation with staff from the NMAI Cultural Resources Centre (National 
		Museum), we have developed a set of low cost, simple-to-use and robust 
		software tools designed to enable the description, annotation and rights 
		management of collections of mixed-media digital and physical objects 
		belonging to indigenous communities. We have also developed a search, 
		retrieval and presentation interface which retrieves different result 
		sets, depending on the user's profile, and aggregates the results automatically 
		into coherent multimedia SMIL (Synchronized )) presentations.
The aim of the software described here is to support 
		such a Program.

In addition, users should be able to view or listen to associated 
		annotations which are clearly attributed to individuals. This approach 
		supports the unambiguous documentation of all views/perspectives - even 
		if they are different or contradictory. The software explicitly displays 
		"who said what and when" rather than displaying only the view 
		of a Museum Curator which may have been deduced from a number of different 
		sources of varying reliability.

		the Protection of Indigenous Knowledge, 11th International World Wide

The system consists of three major components:
Figure 3 - Metadata Types and Sources
Figure 3 illustrates the three types of metadata which can 
		be input and the users/groups who we envisage will provide them.

This Program is to be implemented with regard to the 
		wishes and concerns of indigenous communities and traditional leaders 
		and structured within the boundaries of the obvious and reasonable limitations 
		of the institution. The basis for this program is formed through consultations 
		with official tribal representatives, tribal elders and traditional leaders, 
		and museum staff with respect to museum policies and procedures, and US 
		federal legislation including the National Museum of the American Indian 
		Act, American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA), Native American Graves 
		Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), and the Collections Policy of 
		the National Museum of the American Indian. The Program Committee is cognizant 
		of the fact that it is operating within the constraints of a national 
		museum, and acknowledges that in some instances, dependant upon the beliefs 
		and feelings of the Native community concerned, the proposed implementation 
		of sensitive collections care practices within the museum setting may 
		be deemed inappropriate or presumptuous. In such circumstances, the Committee 
		will endeavour to abide by any alternative direction offered by the concerned 
		Native group.
The User Manager software component illustrated in Figure 
		8 allows the systems administrator to add or remove users and to edit 
		their profiles. Authorized elders will be able to enter the rights constraints, 
		and authorized users will be able to attach annotations. Hence the software 
		affects not only what resources users can access and view but also what 
		metadata tools they can access and hence what metadata they can enter.
Figure 10 - Search Interface
Although a number of other projects have investigated the 
		application of information technology tools to the protection and management 
		of indigenous collections according to customary laws (Ara, Sullivan, 
		Digital, Special), they have not approached the problem using international 
		metadata standards nor developed generic yet flexible systems which are 
		capable of supporting indigenous communities globally, but easily customized 
		to support the particular local customs.
The software should also enable the traditional owners to 
		describe, contextualize and annotate resources in their own words, their 
		own languages and from their own perspectives. The importance and value 
		associated with enabling spoken annotations (in addition to textual annotations) 
		was multi-faceted:
In addition to the descriptive and rights metadata, annotation 
		tools which enable indigenous communities to describe resources in their 
		own words have been provided. Authorized users can input, record and attach 
		either textual or spoken annotations to specific objects or resources. 
		The ability to enter spoken annotations is especially useful and valuable 
		- it provides a natural user interface which supports the oral tradition 
		and allows users to express their stories in their own words and languages. 
		It also acts as a trigger for generating new knowledge and enhancing existing 
		knowledge. Figure 6, below, illustrates the annotation interface. Users 
		can also browse the list of clearly attributed annotations and view/listen 
		to who said what and when about a particular resource.

In this paper we have described a software system developed 
		as a result of consultation with representatives from Indigenous communities 
		and staff from museums, archives, libraries and cultural centres in both 
		Australia and North America. However at this stage the software remains 
		relatively untested within real world applications or real communities. 
		Hence the immediate future involves working closely with a small number 
		of indigenous communities to determine:
The Rights Metadata will be provided by the traditional 
		owners or elders of the indigenous community to whom the resource belongs. 
		Only those users with the required access privileges will be able to input 
		or edit the rights metadata. Support has been provided to enable the definition 
		and application of restrictions based on:

Figure 1 below illustrates how we envisage the software 
		being used to assist with the protection, preservation and repatriation 
		of indigenous knowledge and artefacts which are being shared, exchanged 
		or returned from museums, archives, private anthropologists' collections 
		and cultural institutions back to their original owners. (N.B. We are 
		not considering the repatriation of human remains within the scope of 
		this project.)
