Two distinctly separate lines are within the Labrador's pedigree tree: the "English" and the "American".  The English lines are shorter, bulkier, more mellow and sometimes less inclined to retrieve.   (Only 35 AKC confirmation champions are titled as Master Hunter.) The American lines tend to be tall, thin, high energy and produce more titled retrievers.
Our dogs are in the middle.  My AKC Champion, Emmett, is a titled hunting retriever under NAHRA,  is mellow, but taller than the "English" breeders like.  The "field" people we've mingled with frequenly ask, "Isn't that an English Lab?" Their expression is one of barely supressed mirth and doubt, and then, unable to contain their amusement any longer, they laugh at us when we say we're competing.  No one was laughing when Emmett got a standing ovation by the judge and an exclamation, "Now that's how a retrieve should be done!" He perfectly retrieved a blind toss and  earned his first hunting title that day.  We love you Emmett!!!
About Us and our Dogs
Our names are Scott and Jane Hunter and we have been involved with Labradors since 1986.   We live in the rural community of Picture Rocks, Pennsylvania which is family oriented and beautiful to watch during the seasonal changes. We are in the perfect situation to raise and train Labradors. Our dogs are members of our family and have a special place in our hearts.  We test all of our dogs with OFA for healthy hips and elbows and take our dogs to Cornell University in NY for the annual eye exams.
We breed infrequently, but when we do, great care is taken to select good bloodlines that will complement, not comprise, the integrity of the Labrador's original purpose: retriever, companion, correct confirmation.
