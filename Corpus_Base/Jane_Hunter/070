There remains a possibility that, per son Hamilton's biography which you will see listed under him, that John and family may have spent the years from time of arrival in Canada, 1821 given in the above biography till 1831 in the Bytown area. John shows up first in the 1831 Noyan Census, then, as shown below, in the 1842 St. Armand Census. We should not discount this completely till a thorough search has been made in Methodist and Presbyterian records in the Bytown area. Son, Robert B.'s baptism may show up here.

He is a son of John and Nancy Hunter, who were descended from the Scottish Covenanters, but born in the county Tyrone, in the North of Ireland. They came to Canada in 1821, and settled in the Province of Quebec, but in 1843, removed to Ontario. John Hunter still survives, and is hale and hearty at the advanced age of eighty-two. His wife died 4 years ago, and the three surviving sons are all engaged in the work of the Christian Ministry, namely: the subject of this sketch; the Rev. S. J.

He married, on the 9th July, 1860, Mary Jane, second daughter of Isaac Robinson, of Toronto. Dr. Hunter entered the ministry of the Methodist Church in June, 1856, and during the past twenty one years he has been in charge of some of the most important churches in London, Hamilton, Toronto, and Ottawa. The Dominion Church at Ottawa was built under his direction, and is one of the finest ecclesiastical edifices in Canada. He was chairman of the Ottawa district for three years, and secretary of the Montreal conference. He is at present pastor of the Wesley Church, Hamilton, and superintendant of the Hamilton District. It is only justice to say that Dr. Hunter is one of the ablest and popular ministers in the Methodist communion of this province."
I would like to thank Linda Gerow of the East Gwillimbury Public Library, Judy Antle, archivist for the Mississquoi Historical Society, Michael Costello and Glen Bodie for lookups, and Mary Gordon for further information on the descendants of the Rev. William John Hunter. They have all been of great assistance in locating some of the documentation for this genealogy.

No record yet has been found for Robert B., but as his birth would have been before they arrived in this area, he will likely show up in the district the family resided in before coming to St. Armand.
However, they do not show up in the 1831 census for the St. Armand area, and recent evidence shows that they  spent time in Noyan and Philipsburg between 1831 and 1834:
57351 B&S 7 Apr 1855 George Rear - John Hunter 5 acres, East part of SW1/4. George Rear carried the mail from Newmarket once a week in the early years.61174 B&S 2 Feb 1856 John Hunter - James Weir 1/2 Acre61417 B&S 21 Feb 1856 John Hunter - Henry Shuttleworth 1/4 acre.
Note that, on the baptism of Son, Thomas Anderson Hunter, a note says his father, John Hunter was currently residing in Noyan, Quebec (1833), and from the baptism of son William John Hunter, a note on which says his parents, John and Nancy were then living in Philipsburg (1834) [See article on William John Hunter above] Some time between then and 1842, they seem to have moved back to St. Armand, John then listed as a proprietor of 73 acres. Note: John signed a petition in Noyan in 1841.

"The Rev. H. D. Hunter, M.A., pastor of the First Congregational Church,
London, was born of parents who emigrated from County Tyrone, in the North of
Ireland, about 1830, and settled in Bytown, near Ottawa. They were descended from
the Browns and Hunters of the covenanting times in Scotland; some of the former
suffering death for their loyalty to their faith. Mr. Hunter's parents were Presbyterians;
but, coming to Bytown, "where" as he says, "there was nothing else
to join," they joined the British Wesleyans of that day and became Methodists.
Mr. Hunter, Sr., was a local preacher for sixty years. In this communion, Mr.
Hunter was brought up, and began his ministry in New York in 1872. [Note: the
year after resigning as Postmaster in Mt. Albert, and his two known children were
born there.] He spent two years there, and four in California. Returning to Canada
on a visit he was induced to accept the pastorate of the Newmarket Congregational
Church, where he remained three years, and at the beginning of 1881, accepted
a call to the Congregational Church in London, Ontario, in which position he is
now entering his ninth year. Mr. Hunter, has been for a number of years, a member
of the executive committee, both of the Home Missionary Society, and of the Congregational
Union; and in 1887, served as the Chairman of the latter body. As a preacher and
lecturer Mr. Hunter stands high. He was honored in being appointed as Sabbath
morning preacher by the Union in 1882, and Sabbath evening preacher at the meeting
in 1886. Two of his brothers, both Doctors of Divinity, have held a prominent
place among the Methodists of the Dominion." Despite the fact the references
to the Rev.'s parent's early days bring up questions in the above biography, it
does give some interesting information on his life, which ties in with what we
had already known about his father.

Major Hunter was born in London, Ontario, January 13, 1870, and was educated at the Hamilton Collegiate Institute and the Law School at Osgood Hall. Called to the Bar at Osgood Hall by the late Chief Justice Sir Thomas Galt, he formed a partnership with the late T. H. Ince, under the firm name of Ince & Hunter, then was later associated with A. R. Boswell, KC. The present firm of Hunter & Deacon was organized in 1901, and for more than 20 years, this partnership has endured. Major Hunter has always made real property law his specialty, and is esteemed an authority in this branch of the profession. He was influential in the defeat of two noted rental bills, which were brought before the Provincial Legislature by Hon. Mr. Rollo, and J. C. Ramsden, in the winter of 1920 and 1921. At this time, Major Hunter was made chairman of the Parliamentary committee, which represented the Building Owners' and Managers' Association, the Guild of Toronto Property Owners, the Builders' Exchange, and the many trust and load companies of Toronto.

MAJOR W. E. LINCOLN HUNTER -- In legal circles in the Province of Ontario the name of W. E. Lincoln Hunter stands high. Major Hunter is a son of the late Rev. W. J.

In 1856, the town's post office was moved to a building owned by Robert, probably the store, and he became postmaster. The 1857 Lovell's Directory of the Province of Ontario lists Robert as the town's Postmaster and general storekeeper. The 1867 Province of Ontario Directory again lists Robert as Postmaster and also, as a Justice of the Peace.
From "The Canadian Independent", April 1889, Pg. 101:
From "A Cyclopaedia of Canadian Biography", Rose Publishing
Co., Toronto, 1888:
Dr. Hunter, though a member of every general conference that has been held, has no taste for debate, and seldom enters the arena.  He is regarded as orthodox in his teachings, but never takes things on trust merely.  He thinks for himself, and never burks his opinions, even when they seem to be out of harmony with the generally accepted creeds.

William John Hunter received a good public school education, and afterwards attended Victoria University, Cobourg, pursuing a course in classics and metaphysics, and he obtained the degree of Doctor of Divinity from the Chicago University in June, 1878. Our subject has not confined his attention entirely to church work, but has been zealous in the promotion of temperance, which may be regarded as a sister employment. Whenever the opportunity has arisen to use his voice in forwarding this great cause, he has not remained silent. He is at present a member of the Royal Templars of Temperance. With respect to his religious convictions, it need hardly be said that he has always been thoroughly satisfied with the doctrines of Methodism, and is a most able, broad-minded advocate of the name.

In the first, 1851, where Robert is shown with his parents, he shows as 24 years old, or b. in 1827, In the 1861 census, where he is now listed as married, he is shown as 31, or b. in 1830. In the 1871 census, the last, he is shown as 44. or once again, as in the 1861 census, b. in 1827. Robert is still shown as a merchant, b.

Note: As there is a gap from the date of arrival in Canada of 1821
for John and Nancy given in the Rose Publishing biography for son, William John,
and their turning up in the Noyan Census in 1831, it is possible that they did,
indeed settle first in the Bytown area, moving later to the Eastern Townships.
Son Robert B.'s baptism may show up in Bytown.

From the York County Land Registry Office - Dundas Street East, Toronto:
He early developed an unconquerable thirst for knowledge, and when a mere lad had reached the limit of the common school teacher's power in instruct.  The few books in scanty libraries here and there amongst the neighbours were read with avidity and studied with care. The first money he ever eared was invested in three works that opened to him the vast world of thought, namely: Dick's works, Rollin's Ancient History, and a Latin grammar and reader combined.
The following record exists of the passing of the estate for Robert Hunter,

There was a John Hunter who came to North America aboard the Mount Bay from
Londonderry County, Ireland, which landed in New York, on Aug 12, 1816. This was
a popular landing place for those travelling to the Eastern Townships. Travelling
with him were an Eliza and William Anderson, of Londonderry, as well as a James,
John, Mary, and William Hunter, all of Londonderry. Two of these may have been
his parents, and Nancy may have been the child of Eliza and William. There were
many other immigrant ships from Ireland at the time, landing in both Canada and
nearby U.S. ports, that the immigrant couple could have arrived upon. However,
at this time, it doesn't appear that this was our John.
