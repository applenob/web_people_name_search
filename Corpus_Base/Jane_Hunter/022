The information on this page comes from my Scientology Statistics 
database. While I attempt to be as accurate as possible, errors or 
inaccuracies may be introduced by the source material, the transcription 
process, or database bugs. If you discover an error or problem, please let 
me know by writing to kristi@truthaboutscientology.com.
Note: Preliminary analysis suggests that 
about 60% of people 
who try Scientology do only a single course or service, that 80% of new members 
become inactive within 2 years, and that 65% of those who 
reach the level of Clear become inactive within a year after doing 
so. The older a list, the more likely that a person listed on it is 
no longer involved in Scientology. Please read About These Lists for more 
information.
