David Lodge
Lodge often satirises academia in general, and the humanities in particular, in his
novels. As Lodge was brought up as a Catholic — though he later described himself as an "agnostic Catholic" — many of his characters are Roman
Catholic and their Catholicism is also one of his themes, especially in his novel How Far Can You Go? (published in the U.S. as Souls and
Bodies).

David Lodge (born January 28, 1935 at
London, England) is a British author.

His fictional locales include the town of "Rummidge", modelled after Birmingham, and the equally imaginary US state of
"Euphoria", situated between the states of "North California" and "South California". Euphoria's State University is located in
the city of "Plotinus", right across the Bay from "Esseph", and is a thinly disguised version of Berkeley, California.
Lodge studied at University College London, obtaining a BA in 1955 and an MA in 1959. He went on to
obtain a PhD at the University of
Birmingham, and taught English there from 1960 until 1987, when he retired to
become a full-time writer. He retains the title of Honorary Professor of Modern English Literature at the University and
continues to live in Birmingham. His papers are housed at the University of Birmingham Special Collections.

Several of his novels — in particular, Changing Places, Small World, and Nice Work — have been
adapted into television series.



In the 1998 New Years Honours list David Lodge was appointed CBE for his services to Literature.
