He put it more forcefully in 1980. “As an academic critic and university teacher specializing in modern literature and literary theory,” Mr. Lodge wrote, “I spend much of my time these days reading books and articles that I can barely understand and that cause my wife (a graduate with a good honors degree in English language and literature) to utter loud cries of pain and nausea if her eyes happen to fall upon them.”
“For a couple of decades,” Mr. Lodge recalls, “it was quite intellectually exciting –?the traditionalists slugging it out with the structuralists, and then with the poststructuralists. If you had a stake in the field, this was all intensely stimulating, but after a while it started to pale.”
