The story unfolds by means of the transcripts of Messenger's stream-of-consciousness on-the- fly musings into a tape recorder. (In perfect Lodgeian fashion, Messenger self-consciously edits the transcripts.) Messenger fancies himself a modern, but is confounded by some of modernity's trappings.  In  alternate chapters, the diary entries of Helen Reed, a novelist of some acclaim and considerable self-awareness, are used to let us in on her thoughts and feelings.
Helen Reed's diary entries are not sufficiently believable- for they are often wooden, much too full of tedious description of the obvious - and usually lacking in any trace of the register of a diary. She doesn't seem to be writing for herself, but for Lodge's presumed audience.  This is a real problem in this novel.

The story entertains by means of plotting and timing. As usual from David Lodge there is wit and parody, self-consciousness without narcissism, humor and foolishness,  desire and the reasonable wish to connect  - occasionally running amok. In addition there is Lodge's basic decency toward all. I had hoped for more, though,  from such a capable mind - and wonderful writer.

So what's the problem? Messenger is a familiar man: we've watched him in action in other novels of Lodge's. Unfortunately  in this one he  possesses much less of the the tenderness, the heartrending confusion,  and (sometimes comical) sexual frustration and/or energy - and vulnerability - that made so many of Lodge's previous protagonists  so irresistibly appealing. In addition, Messenger/Lodge's self-referencing begins to seem precious. Characters from past novels (including Robyn Penrose from "Nice Work") make cameo appearances that seem almost token.
"Thinks" is both an academic novel and a comedy of manners - containing elements of all of the above. Within a plot both complicated and much too simple the fictitious University of Gloucester provides the setting for the events.  A bright,  sexually and intellectually restless - and highly verbal - married but chronically adulterous scientist,  Ralph Messenger (a dead ringer for Lodge himself, down to each  facial feature) meets a younger female writer-in-residence at the school.  She is a grieving widow, feeling out of place, away from her home in London, and out of sorts. They close in on one another and pull away - throughout the novel. It's a troubling (and troubled) dance.
