The site that Camp David Lodge is on is an old farmstead. Many buildings have been refurbished to provide a variety of 
                accommodations. The farmhouse has been refurnished to comfortably sleep several adults. The facilities house 
                37 beds. Each hunting party stays in a private building.
Family owned and operated, Camp David Lodge has over 15,000 acres of 
                private natural hunting habitat within ten miles.
