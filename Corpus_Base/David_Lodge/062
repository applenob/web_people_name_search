Welcome to the Official Website 
      of Absalom of David Lodge No. 36 located at 89 Monticello Ave Jersey City 
      NJ 07304
This webpage will allow fellow lodges and chapters to monitor the work 
      of Absalom. We intend for this tool to be 
      used by individuals searching for 
      information on masonry. It will also 
      provide a point of contact to those men attempting to join a Masonic 
      organization.
Absalom of David is the 
      largest lodge in Jersey City with seventy four members on roll. In the 
      information age we feel the need to provide our members with 24 hour 
      access to the lodge.
Please sign the guest book and let us know what you think.
