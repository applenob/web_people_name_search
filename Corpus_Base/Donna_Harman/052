    in the expression of biodiversity data using new information technologies.
    These pages provide an overview of the Working Group and its activities
In recent years there has been enormous growth
    in interest in the potential of digital images, especially as technological
    advances make it now possible to store and access large quantities of
    data relatively cheaply. Coupled to this has been the rapid growth if
    imaging on the World Wide Web (WWW). Many organisations are taking advantage
    of various funding opportunities to digitise parts or all of their collections.
    But the process of digitisation does not in itself make image collections
    easier to manage or to use. There are several computerised image data
    management systems on the market which help to organise and view the
    digital images. Some forms of cataloguing and indexing are still necessary,
    since browsing is not an option except with small collections. These
    problems have stimulated research into content-based image retrieval
    (CBIR), the selection of images from a collection via features automatically
    extracted from the images themselves. Current CBIR systems typically
    provide image retrieval by low-level attributes such as colour, texture
    or shape, and few attempt higher levels of retrieval, such as by semantic
    content (e.g. the presence in an image of specific types of object, or
    the depiction of a particular type of event). There has been little systematic
    evaluation of CBIR system effectiveness on a large scale. Key questions,
    such as whether CBIR techniques can bring about worthwhile improvements
    in performance with real-life image retrieval systems, or where and how
    such techniques can most profitably be used, thus remain unanswered.

The objective of this project is to design efficient
    indexing strategies that support flexible retrieval metric through relevance
    feedback learning. However, trying to satisfy both goals (efficiency
    and flexibility) at the same time leads to a conflict. A novel approach
    is explored to capture the inherent interplay between flexible metrics
    and indexing that has the potential to resolve the conflict. It is hypothesized
    that the interplay can be exploited to create effective content-based
    retrieval systems that meet performance and computational challenges
    encountered in practical image database applications. This exploratory
    project seeks to establish the proof of concept of an approach that trades
    off accuracy for efficiency, and that can avoid exhaustive search in
    large-scale image databases. The methods to be explored are based on
    bump-hunting in high-dimensional data for inducing a set of (possibly
    overlapping) boxes that capture the local data distributions. The induced
    boxes effectively cover the feature space, thereby providing an index
    to the image database. The flexibility and efficiency of the novel indexing
    technique will be tested in heterogeneous image databases that support
    a variety of query types, ranging from query-by-image to query-by-region.
    If successful, the results of this project will enable the use of flexible
    metric learning in large scale image databases, which will have a significant
    impact in content-based image retrieval in broad areas such as health-care,
    scientific images, education, or art.

The rapid accumulation of large collections of
    digital images has created the need for efficient and intelligent schemes
    for image retrieval. Since humans are the ultimate users of most retrieval
    systems, it is important to organize the contents semantically, according
    to meaningful categories. This requires an understandingof the important
    semantic categories that humans use for image classification, and the
    extraction of meaningful image features that can discriminate between
    these categories. Recent research efforts have addressed the first problem,
    but the second remains quite elusive. This research effort is aimed at
    addressing this second problem, that is, the extraction of low-level
    image features that can be correlated with high-level semantics and used
    to capture the semantic meaning of an image.

A central focus of the evaluation framework will
    be the consideration of how well the system supports the user in their
    work, particularly in terms of functionality, interface/access and decision
    support. It must be emphasised that a search system and the search process
    together form the entire information searching and retrieval process
    and it is not acceptable to evaluate the system alone. The image retrieval
    systems will therefore be evaluated in context and from a user-oriented
    perspective.

The key to this research is the development of
    a new methodology for segmenting images, based on perceptual models and
    principles about the processing of texture and color information. This
    involves the identification of semantically important, spatially adaptive,
    low-level color and texture features that can be combined algorithmically
    to obtain image segmentations that convey semantic information. The same
    perceptual models and principles can be used to relate the features of
    the segmented regions (color and texture features, as well as segment
    location, size, and boundary shape) to semantic concepts that can be
    used for content-based image retrieval. An integral part of this research
    is the design and execution of subjective experiments in order to obtain
    some key parameters for the color and texture features, as well as for
    linking low-level image features to image semantics.

There is a wealth of research into users' information-seeking
    behaviour, but almost exclusively in the area of textual information.
    There is little understanding of how people seek for or use images. Recently,
    there has been research and development activity in so-called content-based
    image retrieval (CBIR) where images are selected from a collection via
    features automatically extracted from the images themselves. Current
    CBIR systems typically provide image retrieval by low-level attributes
    such as colour, texture or shape, and few attempt higher levels of retrieval,
    such as by semantic content (e.g. the presence in an image of specific
    types of object, or the depiction of a particular type of event). How
    important is colour, texture or shape to the retrieval of visual information?
    When, and by whom, are higher levels of retrieval needed? What searching
    strategies are appropriate for image retrieval? How important is browsing
    to the retrieval of visual information?

Central to this endeavour is a recognition of the
    need to find effective indexing and retrieval strategies amid the proliferation
    of techniques and tools for the storage and manipulation of digitised
    images. The imperative to incorporate, to a far greater extent, the real
    needs of end-users and to move to a standardised platform, or approach,
    for visual information retrieval developments are clearly indicated and
    will also figure prominently in the project.

The Decentralized Image Retrieval for Education
    (DIRECT) project is developing a peer-to-peer content based image retrieval
    (CBIR) service for the National SMETE Digital Library program. CBIR allows
    the user to designate a query image so that the service can search the
    library for images of similar content. DIRECT matches images not by text
    metadata but by the color, texture, and shape of the image objects. With
    such a system the users of the NSDL do not need to know specialized languages
    to initiate a search. Furthermore, the matching process does not depend
    on a match between the cataloguer description and the user description.
    The system is available to all collections in the NSDL without imposing
    new standards or protocols. This offers the promise for the NSDL to support
    images that have not yet been cataloged or have incomplete metadata,
    without the image collection provider or aggregator having to incur additional
    cataloging overhead.

Over the last two
      decades there has been an explosive growth in online data storage of
      various forms. These large datasets have motivated the rapid development
      of data mining methods. However, until now, there has been a lack of
      an online repository of large data sets for researchers to evaluate
      and compare their methods. In this project, an online repository of
      large and difficult data sets are being gathered that are representative
      of the diverse character of many important scientific and business
      domains. This repository includes high-dimensional data sets as well
      as data sets of different data types (time series, spatial data, transaction
      data, and so forth). The primary role of the repository is that of
      a benchmark testbed to enable researchers in data mining (including
      computer scientists, statisticians, engineers, and mathematicians)
      to scale existing and future data analysis algorithms to very large
      data sets. Each data set in the respository contains online documentation,
      metadata, and links to relevant background domain information such
      as prior published work. Availability of a standard set of large benchmark
      data sets will directly stimulate and foster systematic progress in
      data mining related research, similar to the affect that the UCI Machine
      Learning Data Repository has had on machine learning research. This
      repository will play a substantial role in brokering the gap between
      research-oriented algorithm development in the laboratory and the real-world
      practicalities and challenges of very large data sets. http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html

    critically important. In this project, the Center for Intelligent Information
    Retrieval (CIIR) will study algorithms and mechanisms that facilitate
    the.process of indexing and retrieving images, video, and associated
    text. Specifically, the CIIR will: 1) Develop techniques for browsing
    and retrieving images and videos by content. Image indexing is an emerging
    technology which is poorly understood. New and powerful techniques will
    be developed for indexing images and videos using visual attributes such
    as color, texture and 'appearance'; 2) Develop techniques for indexing
    images and videos using text present in the images. Methods of assisting
    with manual annotation of images will also be studied. The text indexing
    methods will be combined using the INQUERY probabilistic retrieval engine;
    3) Develop and evaluate interactive retrieval and browsing interfaces
    for image, video, and text retrieval. These interfaces will be based
    on novel visualization and user interface work done at CIIR. The CIIR
    will perform user studies to evaluate the appeal and effectiveness of
    the interfaces. In summary, the project will integrate innovative image
    matching, sophisticated text retrieval and new query formulation and
    visualization methods to create a powerful platform for indexing and
    retrieving images, video, and text.***

Many image databases employ image features that
    describe the aggregate shape and color properties of a class of objects,
    and hence, are only capable of "inter-classes" discrimination
    (e.g., airplanes vs. butterflies). These features are sensitive to incidental
    changes in camera viewpoint and scene illumination, which severely constrain
    the appearance of query objects. The goal of this project is to design
    a set of new image-derived features which utilize detailed local image
    analysis to enable discriminating objects of very similar appearance
    within the same class (e.g., "intra-class" discrimination of
    different species of butterflies in a database of butterflies). These
    new features capture the essential traits of imaged objects in a way
    that is insensitive to incidental changes in both global environmental
    factors, such as viewpoint and illumination, and local configuration,
    such as shape deformation and articulated motion. The project addresses
    the efficiency and utility issues in deploying these invariant features
    in large, real-world image databases. In particular, flexible class templates
    are constructed for automating image segmentation and cataloging of database
    objects. Invariant image features are organized in a hierarchical manner,
    using both image-derived and domain-specific information, for efficient
    pruning of unlikely matches. A representation strategy, which combines
    global structure models with local invariant features, is used to achieve
    recognition insensitive to incidental articulated motion and deformation.
    As a result, the new image features are highly discriminative yet insensitive
    to incidental changes in shape, viewpoint, and illumination. In particular,
    they enable invariant, intra-class image retrieval, i.e., highly precise
    recognition and retrieval of images in large databases of similar objects
    (e.g., retrieving images of Old World Swallowtails from a database of
    butterflies) with few constraints on the appearance of query images.
    The results of the project will be disseminated by scientific papers,
    software that can be downloaded, and prototype image databases that can
    be queried on the Web. http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~yfwang

The objective of the proposed research is to investigate
    novel approaches to supporting effective and efficient access to various
    geographic image databases over the Internet leading to design of distributed
    geographic image retrieval systems. The research involves three research
    teams from: SUNY Buffalo, National Center for Science Information Systems
    (NACSIS) in Japan, and the University of Nantes in France. (IRESTE) The
    technical challenges are the creation of a new meta-level system for
    geographic image databases. To achieve this, research issues concerned
    with representation models for geographic data, relationships between
    metadata and resource discovery and efficient query processing in a distributed
    environment must be addressed. The problems addressed are critical to
    retrieval on large volume, multidimensional, distributed data over the
    Internet. Results can be broadly applied to numerous domain and interdisciplinary
    research areas.

The evaluation tool will be developed by performing
    user-centred system evaluations with existing image retrieval systems
    currently in use in various organisations. The initial evaluation procedure
    will be informed by the models of image seeking behaviour developed during
    VISOR I, by a comprehensive review of the relevant literature and by
    input from experts in the field of evaluation. The results of the practical
    work conducted during a pilot phase (i.e. initial user-centred system
    evaluations) will be used to reformulate the evaluation procedure accordingly.
    The resulting procedure will then be used in a second organisation to
    verify the approach and make further modifications as necessary. Finally,
    an evaluation framework to guide the development of electronic image
    retrieval systems will be formulated, incorporating the experience gained
    throughout VISOR II. Throughout the project, feedback sessions will be
    held with both participant organisations and experts in the field.

is a web-driven database for images. The project was
    initiated by Hans van der Voort from SVI, a company producing the Huygens
    software package, used in deconvolution of microscopy images. (SIDB uses
    a 'light' version of huygens to interpret 3-D image data). Started as
    a project by and for undergraduate computer sciences students from the
    University of Utrecht, it matured at the Institute for Molecular Plant
    Sciences from the University of Leiden, the Netherlands, where SIDB is
    now used by many to archive images and other file types. SIDB archives
    2-D, 3-D images. Image files are stored unchanged in a central directory
    (archive). Users of the system are subdivided in groups, and whoever
    owns an image (by uploading it) can determine who else on the system
    is allowed to view and use the image. Files can be uploaded through HTML,
    or using a mounted (smb, NFS, etc..) drive. Entering meta-data is facilitated
    by user-definable templates. The meta-data fields currently in use have
    been designed for images derived by (confocal) microscopy. When combined
    with cheap, large hard drives and a fail-save backup mechanism, SIDB
    provides a perfect means to archive images within the setting of small
    to medium-sized research groups. However, it might be of use wherever
    people collaborate on images.

“One of the most serious bottlenecks in digitizing
    collections is in making them easy to search. The strategy proposed has
    the potential to provide rich, subject-oriented indexing for large image
    collections that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive to describe
    and index using manual techniques. A further advantage of the approach
    is that the descriptive metadata generated may be derived from authoritative
    scholarship in a way not normally feasible in standard cataloging practice.
    The project goal of CLiMB is to develop and test automatic approaches
    to the creation of descriptive metadata for improving access to digital
    library special collections. http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/news/files/2002-04-26.climb.html

    half-tone drawings and line drawings in this database are being accumulated
    as potential illustrations for a guide to the aleocharine genera of North
    America and Mexico, with additional images of taxa from other geographical
    regions for comparison.  Seevers
    (1978) noted that it is probably impossible to identify most aleocharine
    genera without a substantial reference collection.  It
    is our ultimate goal to provide habitus illustrations, photographs and
    line drawings of structural features of all genera.  Hopefully, these will serve as the
    “reference collection” needed to accurately identify aleocharine genera
    (when used with appropriate keys).  Development
    of this image database is a on-going project, and new images will be
    added, and images of poor quality replaced, on a regular basis.  All images in this database are made available thanks

The aim of the present investigation is therefore
    to test the extent to which a systematic application of findings from
    human visual cognition studies can improve retrieval performance. The
    investigation will review the current state of the art in human visual
    perception in some depth, identifying hypotheses and experimental findings
    of potential relevance to shape retrieval. A model of the shape retrieval
    process will be constructed, and used to guide the development of an
    improved shape retrieval prototype, capable of representing and matching
    shapes more effectively than any current system. Specific aspects on
    which the model is expected to concentrate include:

The following is only a selection of the great
    many image databases available on the Web (in whole or in part). Descriptions
    are abstracted from the sites referenced and minimally edited for consistency.
The research will be essentially qualitative in
    nature. The project will study the behaviour of real users of visual
    information in real situations. It will build up a series of case studies
    based on representative organisations from within certain subject domains,
    such as Architecture, Medicine, Journalism and Art History, and will
    study subjects in these organisations who use images/visual information
    as part of their normal work. Through the analysis of relevant documentation
    and current systems and the recordings of interviews and observations,
    the project will categorise the uses of images in different domains and
    thus develop models of the information seeking behaviour of image users.

The goal of this research project is to design
    and implement a system for content-based image retrieval that can (1)
    provide a large variety of image-distance measures that can be used singly
    or in combination to satisfy a wide range of user needs and (2) provide
    rapid access to images, even in an extremely large database. The focus
    of the work is the development of a general, scalable architecture to
    support fast querying of very large image databases with user-specified
    distance measures. This includes the development of distance-measure-independent
    algorithms and data structures for efficient image retrieval from large
    databases. Methods for merging the general, distance-measure-independent
    algorithms with other useful techniques that may be distance measure
    specific, such as keyword retrieval and relational indexing, are being
    pursued. The problem of providing users with multiple distance measures
    of many different varieties is being studied. New methods for combining
    distance measures and a language in which users can specify their queries
    without detailed knowledge of the underlying metrics are being designed.
    A prototype system is being implemented to test the developed methods,
    and evaluation is being performed on both a large general image database
    and a smaller controlled database. The results of this research will
    be: (1) techniques that facilitate rapid retrieval of images by eliminating
    huge portions of the image database from the search, making content-based
    retrieval feasible on very large and growing databases; (2) new, high-level
    methods by which users can combine distance measures to form meaningful
    queries, so that content-based queries can become a standard way to query
    image databases; and (3) a general framework for content-based retrieval
    that can accommodate new distance measures as they are developed by other
    research efforts. The work has application to medicine, art, photography,
    entertainment, and advertising/marketing. https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/servlet/showaward?award=9711771

    from off-site locations. The Cooper Union's 20,000 piece Graphic Design
    Slide Library is the database's original source. It includes donations
    from design organizations, private collectors, and educators, and features
    designs by noted American graphic artists. In the Fall 1998 the project
    acquired the 6,000 digital image Danziger Collection from the Art Center

    retrieval systems for existing customer bases, the study seeks to engage
    with the economic, political and social factors which will condition
    the further development of such systems. From this examination, a guide
    to good practice will be generated, of relevance to those many organisations
    which are planning to update to electronic visual information retrieval

The effectiveness of this model of the shape retrieval
    process will be tested by measuring its effect on retrieval performance
    over the same set of test queries and images as that supplied by the
    Patent Office for the evaluation of the earlier ARTISAN system. It is
    expected that this study will lead to a significant improvement in the
    understanding of the shape retrieval process, which should enable the
    development of more powerful image retrieval systems in the future.

Effective shape retrieval is still proving an elusive
    goal; no current system appears able to mirror human judgements of shape
    similarity with sufficient reliability. One possible reason for this
    is that virtually all current shape retrieval systems derive indexing
    features purely from explicit representations of image elements such
    as region boundaries. The ARTISAN system, developed at the University
    of Northumbria at Newcastle under a previoue British Library Research
    and Innovation Centre grant, is an exception to this, in that it derives
    indexing features from virtual boundaries generated by grouping image
    regions into families using principles derived from Gestalt psychology.
    Cognitive psychologists have accumulated a considerable body of evidence
    about the way the human eye and brain perceive and interpret an image.
    ARTISAN appears to yield promising retrieval results, even though it
    makes only limited use of such findings.

The goal of this research is to develop the necessary
    methodology for automated recognition of generic object and concept classes
    (such as buildings, cars, boats, and trees) in digital images in order
    to substantially improve the process of content-based image retrieval,
    which has relied mainly on low-level color and texture features for matching
    queries to database images. The approach has three major aspects: (1)
    to design new high-level image features including cluster features that
    group together lower-level features and relationship features that capture
    spatial relationships among them; (2) to develop a unified representation
    that can express a large variety of both low- and high-level features
    in a form that can be used by learning systems; and (3) to automate the
    development of recognizers for object and concept classes through the
    use of a hierarchical, multiple classifier methodology. The resulting
    techniques are being evaluated on several different large image databases,
    including commercial databases whose images are grouped into broad classes
    and a ground-truth database that provides a list of the objects in each
    image. The results of this work will be a new generic object and concept
    recognition paradigm that can immediately be applied to automated or
    semi-automated indexing of large image databases. The methodology will
    help to bridge the gap between the high-level needs of users of image
    retrieval systems and the low-level features typically extracted from
    an image. The generic object class recognition algorithms we develop
    will begin a new era of object recognition research, leaving the geometric
    domain and entering the conceptual domain.

During the years from 1758 to 1782 Charles Messier,
    a French astronomer (1730 - 1817), compiled a list of approximately 100
    diffuse objects that were difficult to distinguish from comets through
    the telescopes of the day. Discovering comets was the way to make a name
    for yourself in astronomy in the 18th century -- Messier's aim was to
    catalog the objects that were often mistaken for comets. Fortunately
    for us, the Messier Catalog became well known for a much higher purpose,
    as a collection of the most beautiful objects in the sky including nebulae,
    star clusters, and galaxies. It was one of the first major milestones
    in the history of the discovery of Deep Sky objects, as it was the first
    more comprehensive and more reliable list: Only four objects were initially
    missing because of data reduction errors, which could be figured out
    later though. Today's versions of the catalog usually include also later
    additions of objects observed by Charles Messier and his collegial friend,
    Pierre Méchain, but not included in his original list. The study of these
    objects by astronomers has led, and continues to lead, to important,
    incredible discoveries.For each object, an image is presented together
    with a short description. In addition to the images, we have also included
    some data on these objects such as celestial position (right ascension
    in hours and minutes [h:m], declination in degrees and minutes [deg:m],
    both for the epoch J2000.0), apparent visual brightness in magnitudes
    [mag], apparent (angular) diameter in arc minutes [arc min], and approximate
    distance in thousands of light-years (kilo-light years [kly] please note
    that the decimal point in the distance does not represent true accuracy;
    see explanation of the terms used here). Also, we have constellation
    images which show Messier and NGC (New General Catalog) objects down
    to 12th magnitude.

    research community. Primary support for this project was a grant from
    the Breast Cancer Research Program of the U.S. Army Medical Research
    and Materiel Command. The DDSM project is a collaborative effort involving
    co-p.i.s at the Massachusetts General Hospital (D. Kopans, R. Moore),
    the University of South Florida (K. Bowyer), and Sandia National Laboratories
    (P. Kegelmeyer). Additional cases from Washington University School of
    Medicine were provided by Peter E. Shile, MD, Assistant Professor of
    Radiology and Internal Medicine. Additional collaborating institutions
    include Wake Forest University School of Medicine (Departments of Medical
    Engineering and Radiology), Sacred Heart Hospital and ISMD, Incorporated.
    The primary purpose of the database is to facilitate sound research in
    the development of computer algorithms to aid in screening. Secondary
    purposes of the database may include the development of algorithms to
    aid in the diagnosis and the development of teaching or training aids.
    The database contains approximately 2,500 studies. Each study includes
    two images of each breast, along with some associated patient information
    (age at time of study, ACR breast density rating, subtletly rating for

Field Application
NSF Program 6845 HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM
The objective is to produce a state-of-the-art
    review of the planning, organisation and implementation of electronic
    visual information retrieval systems, based on a study of a representative
    selection of organisations and their client interaction. The study will
    involve the identification of key participants and decision processes,
    the examination of individual system solutions and the local and sectoral
    contexts within which these solutions emerge.
