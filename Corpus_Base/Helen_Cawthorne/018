Congrats to Andy Auld who was the overall winner, to Kevin Dean who was club champ. to Marc Racher and Frederic Guiho who finished 3rd and 4th respectively in their first club races. It was 
                    great to have Helen Cawthorne along for the race and to see Carol & Stuart Trower, along with their coached athletes, as well as ex-BTA Chairman Mick English! Results will be added to the web site shortly.
Well done to everyone who either raced or helped Iain with the duathlon last weekend. The start of a regular race I think...
