Looking for something else?
The Algeria Hotel: France, Memory, and the Second World War by Adam Nossiter, ISBN 0395902452 by


Looking forward to retirement so that he can spend some quality time with his wife, Judge Gregory Brennan is stunned to discover that she would rather follow her dreams and become a medical student, which causes a powerful rift in their marriage.
In this portrait of a marriage in midlife crisis, Marshall shows that marriage is not unlike the general trial court where Judge Gregory Brennan resides. But the ruling in his own case remains to be seen.
