Brennan recommends an introductory letter with four brief, single-spaced paragraphs on one page. It should be addressed to a specific person, not to a title, like "office manager."
"The objective of the introductory letter is to get the prospect to take your call so you can ask for an appointment," said Gregory Brennan of Brennan Communications in Cotati, author of "Successfully Self-Employed."
If you haven't met a prospective customer socially or at a business event, your first contact is usually by letter.
