The Company incorporated in 1968 as The Group Theatre and later added "Vallejo" to its name.  They continued to work at Hogan Auditorium each summer through 1984 when the Company was invited to form a theater company at the Solano County Fairgrounds.  This project ended in 1986; The Company returned to perform at Hogan Auditorium and in 1994, because of high rental fees imposed by the Vallejo

A Little History
All of these studies and plans are necessary to apply for grants and donations from foundations, local, state and federal government funds specified for historic buildings.
Writing the Plans
Vallejo Music Theatre has contacted several consultants who will help bring the project to fruition, once the building is in the Companys name.  Daniel Archer, an Architect in Mill Valley, has agreed to provide a preliminary Architectural Study pro-bono.  He has all of the drawings and is

In Summary
In 1978 the Company increased its programming to two major musicals a year and in 1986 changed the company name to Vallejo Music Theatre, which more aptly suited its goals, purpose and mission.  Around this same time The Company formed a professional playwrights group, "California On Stage," and with some funding from the California Arts Council worked with several professional playwrights in the Bay Area to create plays based on the history of California.  The Company gradually left the organization in capable hands and again focused primarily on Community Theater in Vallejo.
The summer musicals feature many children, giving them an opportunity to gain valuable experience in the performing arts.  Vallejo Music Theatre hires professional directors and designers for all of its productions.

Beginning in 2002 the Company sponsored an original musical developed by a group of young producers, approved by the Disney Corporation and featuring many children and teenagers.  Plans are to continue this program in one way or another to give beginning playwrights and producers a chance to develop their skills and talents.
Some of the items required for a Business Plan are alluded to in this proposal.  A complete Business Plan will include such categories as Market Study (The Companys market includes the nine Bay Area Counties and includes Yolo and Placer counties), Trading Area (Solano, Napa, Contra Costa and Sonoma counties), Population Characteristics (diversity figures for Vallejo only are included in this proposal; Solano and Napa counties reflect similar breakdowns), Population Data (income levels, educational levels, etc.), Target Markets, Audience Potential, delineated existing facilities and preliminary architectural plans.  Engineering studies will also be necessary and the Company is currently seeking a structural engineer to work on this part of the project.  Consultation for engineering needs has been offered by a local business person and is being followed up.
Opera House in 1986, has contacted Robert Bailey, nationwide Consultant for historic theaters and restoration projects, to work up the Business Plan and Feasibility Study.  The price tag for the full-blown study is $25,500.  The Company has contacted and met with Essex and Drake, fundraisers who raised the money for the San Jose Performing Arts Center.  They are simply waiting for the building to transfer into The Companys hands and they will provide services to raise $4.1 million dollars for as proposed cost of $40,000..

Now Vallejo Music Theatre takes on the greatest challenge of all; developing its own performing arts venue with a plan to include as many performing arts groups as possible in the programming of the two proposed new theaters.

Vallejo Music Theatre was formed as an outgrowth of the Vallejo Fine Arts Councils desire to provide money for lighting instruments for Hogan Auditorium.  The first production was Rodgers & Hammersteins "Oklahoma!" in 1967 which raised over $3,000 and was given to the Vallejo City Unified School District for lighting instruments

Beginning almost immediately fundraising events will be scheduled for large groups of people to attend.  Two performing arts companies have approached The Company to provide entertainment for such fundraising events at less than their normal fee or pro-bono.  Members of the community, who have not worked with The Company before, have volunteered to help plan several large fundraising events. A full-time fundraising person will be hired and brought on board to work with businesses and members of the community to retire debt and raise funds for renovations.  The Company will soon establish an endowment fund to help run and maintain the building once it is completed.  A percent of all fundraising will be earmarked for this endowment fund.  It is estimated, that once The Company owns the building, funds will be raised to retire the mortgage and then funds raised will go toward renovations.   Board Member Gregory Brennan has offered to work full-time with The Company as a fundraiser.  His background includes raising large sums of money for a theater program on the East Coast and for Network Theatre Company of Oakland.  His estimated start date is February 1, 2003.  A Capital Campaign Committee is being formed to include several community leaders who have come forward to help with the project.  It is anticipated that this Committee will begin work as soon as Mr. Brennan is on board.
Besides musicals the group, since 1985, also produces an annual Community Messiah Sing-Along, usually the first Saturday in December, to begin the Christmas Season.   In the fall of 1999 the company moved to the Fetterly Playhouse for the Arts, where they currently reside.  Also, in 1999 VMT teamed up with the Vallejo Community Concert Association and Benicia Old Town Theatre Group to form a Performing Arts Alliance to increase ticket sales for all three groups.  The program was put on hold in 2001.  In the meantime, the Concert Association and VMT have held an annual coordinated Oktoberfest in October to raise funds for childrens programs.
Although this project is an ambitious one, it is feasible.  The growth of Vallejo Music Theatre may lead us in unexpected directions; we may need to develop a second organization which handles on the renovation of the Federal Building (or any other building) to provide this much needed performing arts venue in downtown Vallejo.
