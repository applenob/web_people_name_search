
Kevin Brennan, 46, distinguished                     professor and friend
“Kevin treated his graduate students as if they were                     his own offspring, and they in turn held him in the highest                     esteem,” said Russell Callen, an ECE professor and longtime                     friend. “He was an inspiration to everyone around him.”
His interests outside of Tech were as multifaceted as he                     was — from various outdoor activities to reading American                     and scientific history. He joyfully shared his love of life                     with his students and colleagues alike. “It is a great                     privilege to have been a close friend of this outstanding                     and remarkable man,” Professor Callen said. “He                     was an accomplished researcher, a dedicated educator, an avid                     outdoorsman and a true friend.”
Considered among the best of ECE’s classroom teachers,                     Brennan taught both graduate and undergraduate students with                     equal ease and enthusiasm. His influence is fondly remembered                     by his Ph.D. alumni.

Born October 18, 1956, in Elizabeth, N.J., Brennan received                     his bachelor’s degree in physics from the Massachusetts                     Institute of Technology in 1978 and his master’s and                     doctoral degrees in electrical engineering from the University                     of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1980 and 1984, respectively.
“Kevin was truly a talented and dedicated professor,”                     said Roger Webb, chair of ECE. “Distinguished is an                     inadequate descriptor which does not capture the courage that                     enabled Kevin to remain an outstanding contributor to the                     very end.”
Brennan,                           left, with former doctoral student Yang Wang, at the                           Great Wall of China in 1993.
Brennan served on several federal government defense strategy                     groups, primarily having to do with advancing the state of                     the art in military defense technologies while trying to reduce                     operation and support costs. “Kevin was a superb scientist,”                     said Robert J. Trew, former research director with the U.S.                     Defense Department (DoD) who now heads the Department of Electrical                     and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University.                     “I sought him out to work on some projects for the DoD.                     He was able to solve some very difficult and intricate problems                     and add new understanding as to how things functioned and                     operated.”
In 2002, Brennan received the ECE Distinguished Professor                     Award and the Georgia Tech Vice Provost for Research Special                     Recognition Award for Graduate Education and Research Scholarship.                     In 2003, he received the highest honor that a Georgia Tech                     faculty member can attain — the Class of 1934 Distinguished                     Professor Award.
Brennan is survived by his wife and Georgia Tech employee,                     Lea McLees; his mother, Rita Brennan of Ocala, Fla.; his brother,                     Gregory Brennan of Brick, N.J.; and his mother-in-law, Norma                     J. McLees of Auburn, Ga.
Yang Wang and Nabil Mansour studied with Brennan in the early-                     to mid-1990s. “Kevin was an excellent teacher and also                     a good friend to all of us. He was not only intelligent, professional,                     and knowledgeable, but also patient and caring with his students,”                     said Wang. “His rigorous style in scientific research                     and optimistic attitude in life will benefit me forever.”
Brennan specialized in in-depth theoretical analysis of semiconductor                     devices and materials at the submicron level and developed                     superlattice devices for electroluminescent displays, like                     those that glow on car dashboards, and infrared detectors,                     such as those used in night vision goggles. He also created                     computer simulations of high-speed, high-frequency transistors.                     His specialty was modeling wide-band gap semiconductors for                     future high-power, high-frequency, and high-thermal-resistance                     applications such as automobile and jet engines and power                     amplifiers for wireless communication systems.
When Kevin F. Brennan died at the age of 46 after a tough                     and determined three-year battle with pancreatic cancer, he                     left a legacy that will never fade. A professor in the School                     of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), he set the                     bar high for what a faculty member can achieve, while retaining                     the respect, support, and camaraderie of his colleagues, practically                     all of whom he counted as friends.
Upon graduation, he joined Georgia Tech as an assistant professor                     in ECE. At Tech, Brennan was among the first faculty members                     chosen as Institute Fellows. In 2000, he was named the Byers                     Professor in Microelectronics.
Mansour said, “Kevin’s interest in his students                     went beyond research and technical publications. He had unlimited                     support and always had words of encouragement for his students.                     Our success was his primary objective.”
