In THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS the institution of marriage
	is not unlike the general trial court where Gregory presides. But the ruling in Gregory
	and Audrey's own case remains to be seen. Can their disparate life plans be mediated,
	and their differences reconciled? Marshall navigates these many intricacies of contemporary
	family life with her trademark perceptivity, wit and sophistication. She offers a
	nuanced portrait of a marriage in the throes of a midlife crisis, and reveals, with
	an encompassing kindness, the tenderness, frustration, bewilderment, and ultimately
	the joy of a marriage willed to endure.
