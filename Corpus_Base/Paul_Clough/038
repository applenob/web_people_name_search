Pudsey Clough, Cliviger Valley
After a short walk up Pudsey Road from the A646 (T) the prominent outcrop of Reddish Rocks will become apparent. Take the trackway towards this outcrop, keep left, then you will shortly arrive at the entrance to Paul Clough and Coal Clough. Permission to enter Coal Clough must be obtained from Coal Clough Farm. The Gastrioceras subcrenatum marine band can be found in the shale bank shown above.
NB: In Paul Clough you will in fact be going down the Carboniferous succession i.e. the rocks will get progressively older.Â  In Coal Clough you will be climbing up the succession into younger rocks.
