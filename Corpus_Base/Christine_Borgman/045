        S. (Eds.), Handbook of qualitative research (485- 499).Thousand Oaks, 
        CA: Sage. (Says it all. I found it useful)
The course is conducted as a workshop, drawing upon students research 
        projects to study research methods.  We will survey quantitative, qualitative, 
        and historical research designs in this course, also touching upon related 
        issues such as ethics and human subjects protection. The first week of 
        the course will provide a brief review of epistemological issues and basic 
        concepts of research design.  The course is intended to prepare students 
        for further study on specific methods that they will pursue in their own 
        research and for further study of statistics, and to assist in preparation 
        for PhD qualifying exams.

Other useful works for different stages of the research include:
This is the second course in research methods and design for PhD students 
        in information studies, and is being taught for the third time.  Previously, 
        Information Studies PhD students took 291, Introduction to Research Design 
        and Methodology, as a single course.  We divided 291 into part A, now 
        titled, Theoretical Traditions In Information Studies, and part B, which 
        builds upon that background to address practical research design.  Pre-requisite 
        to 291B/285 are 291A and/or 291, and at least one course in descriptive 
        and inferential statistics.  Masters students who have taken the pre-requisites 
        are eligible to enroll.  Graduate students without all of the pre-requisites 
        but with extensive background in epistemology or research methods may 
        enroll with instructors permission.  Graduate students from related fields 
        (education, communication, psychology, etc.) are welcome to enroll if 
        they meet these requirements.

One of the objectives of this course is assist students in building a 
        core personal library on research methods and design.  The three required 
        texts are classics that will assist you in your research career (and in 
        writing your seminar paper). A few additional course materials are available 
        online or will be distributed or put on reserve.  Other materials are 
        recommended, as student interests will vary.

Week 10 (March 13): Quantitative data analysis
12: Evaluation research, 331-355
Students will begin to build their personal libraries on research methods 
        via the course readings.  Materials include two widely-used textbooks 
        on social science research methods and a widely-used publication manual 
        for social science research.
Part 1, An introduction to inquiry
The course texts will provide a high level overview of methods, but you 
        will need more materials specific to the methods selected for your paper.  
        One of the best sources are the Sage University papers (http://www.sagepub.com), 
        which are inexpensive paperbacks on specific topics such as focus groups, 
        factor analysis, sampling, significance testing.  They have a qualitative 
        series and a quantitative series.  Sage is also an excellent source for 
        more extensive books on various social science research methods.  A list 
        of suggested sources is included at the end of this syllabus.
