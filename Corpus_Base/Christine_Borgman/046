IMP #1 (Interface Message Processor) was the first node on the ARPAnet, the predecessor to the Internet.  The now legendary first message was LO  because the IMP at the Stanford Research Institute crashed at the G of LOGIN. Leonard Kleinrock, the UCLA Professor of Computer Science who led the team that launched IMP#1, and whose queueing theories were essential to the original network design, gave us a tour of the technology.  He shared some historical documents, including the hand-written log of activities on IMP#1, and discussed his early visions of computer networks and how they have changed since.  Thanks to Prof. Kleinrock for a most memorable afternoon.
After reading Janet Abbattes book on Inventing the Internet, Prof. Christine Borgman and her students in IS 30, Information Technology and Society, took a field trip to visit the birthplace of the Internet  which is in UCLAs Boelter Hall!
