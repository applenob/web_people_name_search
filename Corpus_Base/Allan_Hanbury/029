Color and texture are two well-studied cues used by both man and machine in object recognition and scene understanding. When the basic problem is analysis of object surfaces, there has been a long standing debate on whether color and texture should be processed separately or jointly. The basic objective in this talk is to contribute to this debate.  We will describe a recently proposed illumination minvariance model - a transformation scheme for illumination invariance.  We then present results of the application of the model in color texture analysis, face recognition, and general image enhancement.
