For many years it has been well established scientifically that
all known forms of life, including human beings, have developed by a
lengthy process of evolution. It is also verifiable today that very
primitive forms of life, ancestral to all living forms, came into
being thousands of millions of years ago. They constituted the trunk
of a "tree of life" that, in growing, branched more and more; that
is, some of the later descendants of these earliest living things, in
growing more complex, became ever more diverse and increasingly
different from one another. Humans and the other highly organized
types of today constitute the present twig-end of that tree. The
human twig and that of the apes sprang from the same apelike
progenitor branch.
Creationism is not scientific; it is a purely religious view held
by some religious sects and persons and strongly opposed by other
religious sects and persons. Evolution is the only presently known
strictly scientific and nonreligious explanation for the existence
and diversity of living organisms. It is therefore the only view
which should be expounded in public school courses on science, which
are distinct from those on religion.
(The following statement first appeared in the
Humanist of January/February, 1977.)
In recent years, the evidence for the principle of evolution has
continued to accumulate. This has resulted in a firm understanding of
biological evolution, including the further confirmation of the
principle of natural selection and adaptation that Darwin and Wallace
over a century ago showed to be an essential part of the process of
biological evolution.

Sponsoring Committee

We, the undersigned, call upon all local school boards,
manufacturers of textbooks and teaching materials, elementary and
secondary teachers of biological science, concerned citizens, and
educational agencies to do the following:
There are no alternative theories to the principle of evolution,
with its "tree of life" pattern, that any competent biologist of
today takes seriously. Moreover, the principle is so important for an
understanding of the world we live in and of ourselves that the
public in general, including students taking biology in school,
should be made aware of it, and of the fact that it is firmly
established in the view of the modern scientific community.

Scientists consider that none of their principles, no matter how
seemingly firmly establishedand no ordinary "facts" of direct
observation eitherare absolute certainties. Some possibility of
human error, even if very slight, always exists. Scientists welcome
the challenge of further testing of any view whatever. They use such
terms as firmly established only for conclusions founded on
rigorous evidence that have continued to withstand searching
criticism.
Linus Pauling, research professor, Linus Pauling Institute of
Science and Medicine, Menlo Park, California
The principle of biological evolution, as just stated, meets these
criteria exceptionally well. It rests upon a multitude of discoveries
of very different kinds that concur and complement one another. It is
therefore accepted into humanity's general body of knowledge by
scientists and other reasonable persons who have familiarized
themselves with the evidence.
