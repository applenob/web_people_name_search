The Perseus website was created by academics who seem incapable of communicating simply and directly.  Their help-system is of little help. [tutorial/critique]
The default configure-display settings add random blue word-links that you should turn off via the 'Configure display' link (at the top of every page). Set "Lookup Tool Links" to 'No'. ('Lookup Tool' is their jargon for search-engine.)  These random links just deliver a search-engine query of the whole website, dumping great gobs of irrelevant hits.

In fact, you basically shoehorn the world into a weird Aristotelian universe gone mad. On the other hand, there are a lot of strengths to this. You can encode things you couldn't encode otherwise."

bibliog
Here, '1999.03' is the id-number for the English Renaissance collection, and '0031' means that this version of Hamlet was the 31st document added to that collection.  'Perseus%3Atext%3A' translates to 'Perseus:text:' [conversion table] but it seems unnecessary.

The homepage has six levels of tables!?!
The Perseus etext-structure is almost entirely unreadable: very short pages, clumsy navigation, opaque urls, and a shrunken fontsize. [example] [help-page] (If you need to read a many-page document there, and your connection is slow, try alternating between two simultaneous windows-- editing the pagenumbers yourself in the url-- so the next one can be loading as you read the other.)
URLs for etext-pages often look like this (from Hamlet):

As of April 2002, the London maps seem to be entirely separate from the world maps, and none are well documented.
They also offer images, if you're into that stuff. [browser] [intro]
For Shakespearean texts, you may decide to uncheck 'Cross references in dictionaries' instead, because there's one dictionary there that defines almost every word.
'scene%3D%232' translates to 'scene#=2' which is enough to specify the desired webpage (without 'layout' or 'loc').  Even better, you can say:

Some texts do have very useful annotations, though, which you have to turn on via 'Configure display'.  Try checking all the checkboxes for 'Cross references'-- but turn off 'Lemma mapping'. (A lemma is "A word or phrase treated in a glossary or similar listing" [def] so 'mapping' all the lemmas means lots more distracting markup making the text even harder to read.)

Navigation options are left- and right-arrows, a searchbox displaying the current location that you can reset (if you can correctly guess the numbering system), and the clickable blue bar that jumps to any point in the text (the red part is like a 'proportional' scrollbox).
The lefthand-column's link 'Plot [sites] in this document' is potentially fun: it tries to mark all the mentioned places on a handsome map. [eg for Hamlet]  But because these are generated automatically, it often mistakes persons for places (like Ophelia, New Jersey).
Most interesting to me are the secondary sources (scholarly critical works and reference books).

They were early adopters of SGML, and still store their documents in that format, behind the scenes.  This is supposed to allow things to be 'easily' 'automated'-- but who wants to experience art thru the distorting lens of automated markup?  (If they really cared for the art, they'd choose to handcraft each page.)
The background is set to white, but the text-color is not set (tut, tut).
