The Art of Funk George Clinton lets his `cosmic slop' spill onto the canvas
--Joan Baez -- charcoals and watercolors of puppets and 
cats
--Jerry Garcia -- trippy designs, many reproduced for his 
line of silk ties
``The guy that talked me into doing it is the guy that did our 
album covers (Overton Lloyd),'' Clinton says. ``He kept buying me 
brushes. I'd do real good stuff until the brushes got old, or till I 
got too many colors on one brush.
--John Cougar Mellencamp -- freakish, medieval-style 
portraits (what, no ``Pink Houses''?)
Working out of a trailer he had originally intended to use as an 
echo chamber for his recordings, the performer has completed at least 300 paintings so far.
Clinton has been busy of late. Last weekend, 
he was in Los Angeles meeting with his longtime friend the Artist 
(Clinton's groups have recorded for Prince's Paisley Park label). He 
was also working on a Nike ad campaign and making an appearance in 
the comic movie ``The Breaks.''
``I've always liked Salvador Dali,'' Clinton says, ``mainly for 
the way things were put together that didn't seem like they should be 
together. Stuff like a watch bent over a cactus.''
--Perry Farrell of Jane's Addiction -- orgiastic dioramas. 
``Art is the ultimate drug''
``To me, the more things you appreciate, the better off you are.''
``Like I do music, I just throw so much stuff in there and then 
start editing it out until it looks like something,'' he says with a 
laugh. ``Somebody usually has to stop me.''
Clinton says plenty of his friends and acquaintances have been 
encouraging.
--David Bowie -- gaunt, blue-in-
the-face portraiture
--Cat Stevens -- pre-mystical street scenes (``Teaser and 
the Firecat'')
There are, however, a few youthful activities that he has yet to 
grasp. ``I cannot figure out how you could get anybody to 
break-dance,'' he laughs, ``or play video games. The kids pick up on 
video games like it's second nature to them.
Painting, says the 57-year-old creative dervish, is a great way to 
relax. ``When I come off the stage, it takes an hour just to come 
back down, to settle down from the hype in my own head. Painting 
these things -- I found it's addictive as hell.''
``I can vibe on that.''
With his flowing robes and peacock-hued hair extensions, funk 
grandfather George Clinton has established himself as one of the most 
colorful figures in pop music. If that's true, though, he can't see 
it.
``One thing I really like is that he's so original and free,'' 
says Bob Abbott, Clinton's unofficial art adviser and the curator of 
F.A.C.T. Gallery, the Laguna Beach space that first showed Clinton's 
work. ``I relate a lot of his work to (Jean-
Michel) Basquiat. It has that feel.''
--Miles Davis -- headstrong abstraction, a fusion of styles
``I'm colorblind,'' he says.
--Cris and Curt Kirkwood, Meat Puppets -- heat-stricken 
absurdity (sample title: ``My, You Have a Nice Kitchen'')
--Judy Collins -- watercolors and acrylics of fine-china 
patterns
--Ringo Starr -- finger-paintings
For Clinton, painting is another way to stay young, just as he 
has dabbled in hip-hop in recent years.
After doodling for years and working on paintings to help 
communicate his ideas for P-Funk's stage sets, Clinton recently began 
showing his work in public. A Laguna Beach art dealer convinced him 
to mount a show, which was followed by an exhibit at the Tallahassee, 
Fla., airport, near Clinton's home.
--Carly Simon -- placid impressionism

Gautier, Journey Editions, 1994
That's a surprising admission, especially given Clinton's latest 
obsession: painting. This Friday, the performer will be on hand at 
San Francisco's Beach Street Gallery to open a three-day exhibit of 
his artwork.
``Now my nephew will wash 'em out for me, keep 'em clean. I do 
pretty good work when I don't have to rush it.''
Picasso is another Clinton favorite; so is ``what's-his-name -- 
Campbell's Soup'' (Andy 
Warhol). Others, however, might dumbfound fans. One in particular: 
Norman Rockwell.

Auditorium on September 12. Call (510) 762-BASS.
--Donna Summer -- bronze work, painting, lithography. 
Recurring title: ``Driven by the Music''
``I put myself in a position to do stuff I pretty much don't know 
anything about,'' he says. ``I guess the way I do it seems to work.''
Here are some other pop artists and their milieus.

``Cosmic slop'' is one of many self-imposed musical descriptions of 
Clinton's group, the long-running funk collective Parliament-Funka 
delic. The term might also be used to describe the bandleader's 
paintings.
As goofy as that name sounds coming from Clinton's lips, the 
artist has a simple explanation. ``It's an extreme, the exact 
opposite (of me). But if people like it, you better try to find out 
why it worked.
``Older people, you'd break your neck thinking about what you have 
to do to move like that.''
As an art student, he admits, his knowledge is limited. Given 
P-Funk's absurdist party music, some of his painting inspirations 
make perfect sense.
--Don Van Vliet (Captain Beefheart) -- trailer-park madness; 
now a full-time painter hidden away in rural California
The two disciplines have plenty in common, he says. ``I mean, they 
have the same terminology -- harmonies, tones, values, stuff like 
that.
