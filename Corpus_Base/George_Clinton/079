George Clinton
Aside from James Brown, George Clinton is the most innovative, influential, and sampled artist in the history of funk.
In Parliament, Funkadelic, or solo, Clinton's blend of acid rock, funk, R&B, and camp was always groundbreaking.
George Clinton & co. have influenced a bevy of musicians ranging from Dr. Dre to the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
