George Clinton Loses Songs

George Clinton
A handwriting expert was called into the case and testified that
the signature from 1983 was most likely Clinton's, refuting his
claim that he did not sign the contract. According to Bridgeport
president Armen Boladian, who testified at the trial, Clinton
signed the deal so the company could retrieve more than a million
dollars advanced to him during his financial troubles during in the
Eighties.
Clinton argued that he had never signed a valid contract and
thus was entitled to income from the songs. He also claimed in his
lawsuit, filed in 1999, that he was deprived of money when a number
of rap musicians used samples of his old songs but did not pay him
fees.

U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle ruled on January 29th that the
music written by Clinton between 1976 and 1983 belonged to
Bridgeport Music, a Michigan-based publishing company. According to
the judge, Clinton signed the rights away to his work in a 1983
contract. Hinkle also prevented Clinton from profiting from the
songs, ruling that the singer did not disclose them in his 1984
bankruptcy filing as a source of possible future income.
