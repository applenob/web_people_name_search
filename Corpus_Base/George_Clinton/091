Two days earlier, on
March 2, 1805, Burr had regaled the Senate with a "correct and elegant" farewell oration
so laden with emotion that even Clinton's friend, Senator Samuel L. Mitchill (R-NY),
pronounced the scene "one of the most affecting . . . of my life."

Clinton's age and infirmity had, if anything, enhanced his value to the president, because
Jefferson intended to pass his party's mantle to Secretary of State James Madison when
he retired after his second term, yet he needed an honest, "plain" Republican vice
president in the meantime. Clinton would be sixty-nine in 1808, too old, Jefferson
anticipated, to challenge Madison for the Republican presidential nomination. Clinton
had already retired once from public life, in 1795, pleading ill health.
But when Clinton
assumed the presiding officer's chair on December 16, 1805, two weeks into the first
session of the Ninth Congress, he was so "weak & feeble" of voice that, according to
Senator William Plumer (F-NH), the senators could not "hear the one half of what he
says."
