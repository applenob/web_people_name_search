Edward Fox

From All Movie Guide: The brother of film star James Fox, British actor Edward Fox spent the first few years of his career in the shadow of his longer-established younger sibling. All this changed when Edward was cast as the charismatic but cold-blooded international assassin The Jackal in 1973's Day of the Jackal;  so determined was Fox's  character to go through with his assignment to kill Charles De Gaulle that at times the audience believed he was actually going to get away with it! Never a major box-office attraction, Fox has aged into a dynamic character player, busy throughout the 1980s in such films as Never Say Never Again (1983), The Shooting Party (1984) and Wild Geese II.  In 1991, Fox could be seen by TV fans as King Richard in Robin Hood,  the "rival" production to Kevin Costner's  Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide
