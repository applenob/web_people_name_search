Subsequently, queries to Beebe/Beebee/Bebe
message boards (orchestrated by Gray Zaruba and/or Mary Ann Legris) returned
two responses:  Alan Henry and Donald Beebe both had Alzina Fox married
to Lovel Beebe, and living in 1850 and 1860 in Ridgeville, Lorraine County,
Ohio.  According to census returns for 1850, Alzina's sister, Wealthy
(age 20), and brother, Anthony (age 24), were living in the Beebe household.
Fox
- Mitchell - Leffingwell
Her father's name was Aaron Fox, who died
rather young, leaving a wife and eight children, all small; three of the
youngest being given to families to raise. My Mother being given at the
age of nine, to this family "Cal Giddons", after which they came from Ohio
to Freeport, Illinois. This is the man my father came to work for and stayed
for three years. Our family was seven boys and five girls. They lost one
boy and raised eleven children to adulthood.
My Mother [i.e., Lydia (Fox) Owen] passed
away March 29, 1909, at the age of 84 years, 5 months, 6 days. She lived
3 months, 12 days, of a longer life than my Father. They were married nearly
62 years. They are both laid to rest in the Ashland, Nebraska, cemetery
Perhaps there is not a connection
between one of these Giddings families and Lydia Fox, but the dates, migration
to Stephenson county and the absence of a Giddons family in Cuyahoga and
Stephenson counties gives strong support to the assumption.
Alzina
Fox, born about 1817 (according to the 1850 U.S. census for Lorraine
County, Ohio) or about 1813 (according to the 1860 census). Said to have
married "a Beebee" (according to Josie's biography of Lydia).
In the 1870 census for Cuyahoga, we found
two Beebees, both in Parma.  The records are almost illegible, but
it would appear that Alonzo Beebee age 51 (or 54)  married an "Adeline"
(or some close approximation thereof) before 1849.  We are unable
to deciper Adeline's age from this record.  Hiram Beebee, age 43,
married an an Alzina (or something like it), age 38 (? -- the record is
suggestive, but not conclusive) in or before 1856.  In both records,
husband and wife are said to have been born in New York, but Adeline and
Alzina Fox were both supposedly born in Ohio.
Alan Henry's data for Alzina (as reported
to us by Dr. Zaruba, 2 December 2002): Alzina Fox, born about 1817 in New
Hampshire, married Lovel Beebe on 23 October 1839 in Loraine County, Ohio. 
Lovel was born 30 March 1811 in Waterbury, New Haven County, Connecticut,
son of Chester and Marcia (Caulkins) Beebe.  Lovel, a stone mason,
died in July 1883 and is buried in Ridgeville Township, Ohio.  In
the 1850 census, Lovell's wife is called "Alzina," and her age is given
as "33."  In the 1860 census, she is called "Alvina," aged 47. 
Children of Lovel and Alzina (Fox) Beebe --  Ellen Beebe, born in
Ohio about 1843; Dallas Beebe, born in Ohio about 1845; and Isadora Beebe,
born in Ohio, 19 May 1849, died 19 September 1850.  The 1880 census
for Lorraine County shows in Ridgeville: Lovel, age 67 (father and mother
born in Connecticut) and his wife, Alizna, age 61 (father and mother born
in New York).  A Dallas Beebe, marble setter, is found in Cleveland
in the 1880 census with wife Emma and children Stanley, Charles, and May. 
The Ridgeville Center Cemetary has three Beebe plots, in one of which are
buried Lovel, Isdora [Isadora?] and Stanley.  Alzina's burial place
has not been discovered.
